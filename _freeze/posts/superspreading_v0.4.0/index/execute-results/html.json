(2003)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02104) (#124, #133).\n\n* A new vignette, `emergence.Rmd`, has been added that covers the functionality of `probability_emergence()` and reproduces the two figures from [Antia et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02104) as well as a figure using the multiple introductions extension (#124, #133).\n\n* Alt-text has been added to all plots across all vignettes (#129).\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n* The `percent_transmission` argument in `proportion_transmission()` has been renamed to `prop_transmission` (#130).\n\n## Minor changes\n\n* An `.aspell/` folder is added to the package including `defaults.R` and `superspreading.rds` to supply a wordlist to the CRAN spell checking to avoid quoting names in the `DESCRIPTION` (#127). \n\n* Package and function documentation has been updated. Vignette changes include minor reworking of text, updating any information or links that were outdated; function documentation is styled more consistently and follows the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html) (#131, #134).\n\n* Internal code style has been updated to adhere to current best practice (#125).\n\n* The package lifecycle badge has been updated from _experimental_ to _stable_. CRAN status, CRAN downloads, repo status and Zenodo DOI badges have been added to the `README` (#119, #132).\n\n* The {pkgdown} `development: mode` has been set to `auto` now the package is hosted on CRAN (#118).\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n* None\n\n## Deprecated and defunct\n\n* None\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n[&#x0040;chartgerink](https://github.com/chartgerink) [&#x0040;joshwlambert](https://github.com/joshwlambert)\n",
