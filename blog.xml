  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Most of our work at Epiverse TRACE involves either developing an R package from scratch or adopting and maintaining an existing R package. In the former case, decision-making during development is guided by internal policies documented in the <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/blueprints/">Epiverse-TRACE blueprints</a>. However, a less common scenario for us has been taking on the maintenance of an existing package — a situation we recently encountered with the <a href="https://epiforecasts.github.io/bpmodels/">bpmodels</a> R package.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to share some considerations and lessons learned from maintaining bpmodels, originally developed by Sebastian Funk at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (with contributions by Zhian Kamvar and Flavio Finger), and the decision to retire/supersede it with <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/blueprints/">epichains</a>. The aim is not to define strict rules but to spark a conversation about good enough practices and alternative approaches that the R developer community has used or would like to be used more widely.</p>
<p>One of the first considerations was the scope of the package. When maintaining or re-imagining an R package, assessing its scope and identifying opportunities for refinement is crucial. For example, some packages have evolved significantly in the broader R ecosystem to better align with user needs. We will highlight a few examples. <a href="https://github.com/hadley/plyr">plyr</a> was split into <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html">dplyr</a> and <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/index.html">purrr</a> for manipulating data frame and list objects respectively, reflecting more specialized functionality based on object types. Similarly, reshape evolved into <a href="https://github.com/hadley/reshape">reshape2</a><sup>1</sup> and currently into <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/index.html">tidyr</a>, with each iteration simplifying and improving upon its predecessor. Another example is the <a href="https://github.com/njtierney/naniar/#a-note-on-the-name">renaming</a> of ggmissing into the more generalized <a href="https://naniar.njtierney.com/">naniar</a>. In the epidemiology ecosystem, two examples include the evolution of the <a href="https://epiforecasts.github.io/EpiNow/">EpiNow</a> into <a href="https://epiforecasts.github.io/EpiNow2/">EpiNow2</a> and <a href="https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/">incidence</a> to <a href="https://www.reconverse.org/incidence2/index.html">incidence2</a>.</p>
<p>For bpmodels, we wanted to <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains/issues/142">unify the simulation functions</a> (existing as two functions previously) and improve the function signature by <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains/pull/33">renaming</a> several of the arguments for readability. We also wanted to <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains/issues/4">introduce an object-oriented workflow</a> to aid in interoperability (in some inputs and outputs) with existing tools such as <a href="https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/">epicontacts</a> and <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/">epiparameter</a>. Moreover, the object-oriented backend would also allow us to implement custom methods for printing, summarising and aggregating the simulation output. Some of these considerations would have been less disruptive and in line with the concept of progressive enhancement discussed in <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/progressive-enhancement/">a previous blogpost</a>. However, the change in function name and signature would have led to a lot of disruptions including <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/lifecycle.html#deprecating-a-function">deprecating</a> the existing functions and arguments.</p>
<p>One thing is clear from the examples on scope changes - they often lead to name changes. Another important decision was whether to rebrand the package with a new name. A new name can signal a fresh approach and address limitations of the original package. The most popular example is the renaming of ggplot to <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html">ggplot2</a>. Others include renaming reshape to reshape2 and further, tidyr. However, changing a package’s name can be disruptive and cause <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/lifecycle.html#sec-lifecycle-breaking-change-definition">breaking changes</a> in downstream packages or workflows that use them. The process, if not well handled, can lead to confusion and frustration in the user and developer community. With this in mind and to enable reproducibility of existing work using bpmodels, we decided to fork the <a href="https://epiforecasts.github.io/bpmodels/">bpmodels</a> repository to the Epiverse-TRACE GitHub organisation and maintain the old package. At the same time, we introduced epichains as the successor. The name reflects the fact that it is a package for simulating and analysing <em>epidemiological transmission chains</em>.</p>
<p>A second key consideration is the plans that the original package author(s) may have had and their views on any future changes. In our case, this was fairly straightforward because the maintainer of the original package was fully involved in the refactoring process. We were able to reach and receive approval from another package author who had made substantial contributions. More generally, however, bringing all package authors on board with, for example, changes in scope and name is an important step in taking on maintenance of a package and one that should not be neglected.</p>
<p>We also had to consider whether to archive bpmodels or allow it to co-exist with epichains. We decided to keep bpmodels accessible to sustain the reproducibility of existing code using the package. The package was moved back to the epiforecasts <a href="https://epiforecasts.github.io/bpmodels/">GitHub organisation</a> where it originated from. We, however, added a <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/bpmodels/blob/main/README.Rmd#L19">lifecycle badge</a> to communicate the package’s retired status and text in the README about <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/bpmodels/blob/main/README.Rmd#L29">our plans</a> to only maintain the required infrastructure to keep the package running but not to add any new features.</p>
<p>Another technical consideration was how to handle previous contributions recorded as commit histories. When forking a package, it’s important to decide whether to retain the commit history. Options include squashing the history to start with a clean slate, which risks losing visibility of past contributions, or tagging the HEAD commit of the original repository and building from there. For bpmodels, we decided to go with the second approach, which allowed us to keep the GitHub commit history intact to retain the contributions of its original authors.</p>
<p><a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic versioning</a> was another <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains/issues/32">key decision point</a>. Since epichains was not going to be available immediately but would be developed in the open (on GitHub), we needed to consider how to communicate that to potential users. We decided to start at version <code>0.0.0.9999</code> to signal an experimental and unstable phase<sup>2</sup> while iterating on features through <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains/releases/tag/v0.1.0">minor releases</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, we drew inspiration from various sources. Hadley Wickham’s <a href="https://github.com/hadley/reshape/blob/master/README.md#introduction">reasoning</a> for reshape2 as a reboot of reshape and Nicholas Tierney’s <a href="https://github.com/njtierney/naniar/#a-note-on-the-name">reason</a> for renaming ggmissing to naniar were helpful. Additionally, a talk at UseR! 2024 entitled <a href="https://userconf2024.sched.com/event/1c90V/r-evolution-the-retirement-of-r-packages-with-many-reverse-dependencies-edzer-pebesma-university-of-muenster-roger-bivand-norwegian-school-of-economics">“retiring packages with extensive reverse dependencies”</a> offered practical advice.</p>
<p>This transition has raised several questions for the community. How do you decide whether to supersede or deprecate a package? What strategies have worked for maintaining backward compatibility while introducing new tools? How do you document and communicate major changes to users? How is all of this done while appropriately crediting past contributions and retain discoverability and citation/use tracking?</p>
<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Let’s start a conversation about maintaining and evolving open-source tools in a sustainable way.</p>

  <title>superspreading v0.3.0</title>
  <dc:creator>The Epiverse-TRACE development team</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/superspreading_v0.3.0/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We are very excited to announce the release of a new <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading">superspreading</a> version v0.3.0. This is the first version of superspreading to be on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=superspreading">CRAN</a> (the package can now be installed with <code>install.packages()</code>). Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.</p>
<p>The third minor release of the <em>superspreading</em> package contains enhancements to several functions and a new vignette.</p>
<p>We are also pleased to welcome Dillon Adam (<a href="https://github.com/dcadam"><span class="citation" data-cites="dcadam">@dcadam</span></a>) as a new package author for his contributions towards this version.</p>
<section id="new-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features">New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>proportion_transmission()</code> function has been expanded to incorporate a new method. The new method calculates the proportion of transmission from X% the most infectious individuals, corresponding to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature04153">Lloyd-Smith et al.&nbsp;(2005)</a> calculation. The <code>proportion_transmission()</code> has a new <code>method</code> argument to toggle between the two calculations (<span class="citation" data-cites="dcadam">@dcadam</span>, #99).</li>
<li>A new vignette explaining the methods in the <code>proportion_transmission()</code> function (#101).</li>
<li>{bpmodels} is removed as a package dependency and a branching process simulation function, modified from <code>bpmodels::chain_sim()</code>, is added to the {superspreading} package (#103). <span class="citation" data-cites="sbfnk">@sbfnk</span> is added as copyright holder and <span class="citation" data-cites="jamesmbaazam">@jamesmbaazam</span> as a contributor.</li>
<li><code>probability_contain()</code> is enhanced to enable to probability of containment within a certain amount of time since the outbreak started. This adds <code>outbreak_time</code> and <code>generation_time</code> arguments to <code>probability_contain()</code>. This addition is backwards compatible as by default the time is unlimited, <code>outbreak_time = Inf</code>, and no generation time is required.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="breaking-changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>stochastic</code> argument in <code>probability_contain()</code> has been renamed <code>simulate</code> to be consistent with other functions (#103).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="minor-changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minor-changes">Minor changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The proportions output of <code>proportion_*()</code> functions are now formatted to significant figures rather than rounding to prevent small values being rounded to zero (#102).</li>
<li>Improve input checking, error messages and edge case handling for functions (#102).</li>
<li>Vignettes now use <code>rmarkdown::html_vignette</code> instead of <code>bookdown::html_vignette2</code> and <code>as_is: true</code> has been removed due to changes to {pkgdown} in v2.1.0. {bookdown} has been removed as a suggested package and code folding is removed from vignettes. KaTeX headers have been added to <code>_pkgdown.yml</code> for correct math rendering (#104 &amp; #109).</li>
<li>The <code>get_epidist_params()</code> internal function has been renamed <code>get_epiparameter_params()</code> since {epiparameter} renamed the <code>&lt;epidist&gt;</code> class to <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> (#100).</li>
<li>Internal constants have been added to the package and used by functions (#111).</li>
<li>Checking if the user specifies individual parameters (<code>R</code> and <code>k</code>) or provides an <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> object is now in <code>.check_input_params()</code> (#111).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="bug-fixes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>None to {superspreading} functions.</li>
<li>Update {epiparameter} use in vignette and tests (#106).</li>

<p>This is a follow-up blog post to the <a href="data-licensing.html"><em>Dual licensing R packages with code and data</em></a> post published in September 2024. It contains learnings from submitting <strong>epiparameter</strong> to CRAN with a dual license.</p>
</div>
</div>
<section id="overview-of-previous-blog-post-on-r-package-licensing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-of-previous-blog-post-on-r-package-licensing">Overview of previous blog post on R package licensing</h3>
<p>We previously published a <a href="data-licensing.html">post on the Epiverse-TRACE blog discussing the importance of licensing code and data for open source</a>. It covered the differences between open source licenses for code and those that are required for other forms of information, in our case, data. R packages most commonly distribute code, and therefore require an <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-exts.html#Licensing">appropriate open source license</a>. Less frequently, R packages are used to bundle and share data, so-called <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/data.html">“data packages”</a>, and require an applicable license for reuse and redistribution. We recommend reading <a href="data.licensing.html">the original blog post</a> for a more in-depth explanation of each of these points.</p>
<p>However, since publishing the original post, the last section, <em>Licensing code and data in one R package</em>, has become outdated given our experience submitting the epiparameter package to CRAN with a dual-license. This blog post provides an updated <em>Licensing code and data in one R package</em> section with learnings from epiparameter package development and CRAN submission.</p>
</section>
<section id="licensing-code-and-data-in-one-r-package" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="licensing-code-and-data-in-one-r-package">Licensing code and data in one R package</h3>
<p>If you are developing an R package that has both code and data as primary objects of (roughly) equal importance, a software license inadequately covers the data, and a data license inadequately covers the code. Dual licensing can help resolve this issue. This means there is one license for code (for example, <a href="https://mit-license.org">MIT license</a>) and another license for the included data (for example, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt">Public Domain Dedication</a>).</p>
<p>After conducting an online search, dual licensing for R packages seems rare. An interesting example of dual licensing is the <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraphdata/blob/main/LICENSE"><strong>igraphdata</strong> package</a>, which contains several licenses: One for each dataset included in the package. Similar to igraphdata, we dual licensed the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter"><strong>epiparameter</strong> package</a>, which until versus v0.4.0 contained both code and data. We <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/v0.3.0/DESCRIPTION#L28">licensed the code using the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file</a> and used <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/v0.3.0/LICENSE">the <code>LICENSE</code> file</a> to license the data under CC0. Concretely, we included this additional text in <code>LICENSE</code> to clarify the dual license and that we recommend citing the original source regardless:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>All data included in the epiparameter R package is licensed under CC0 (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt" class="uri">https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt</a>). This includes the parameter database (extdata/parameters.json) and data in the data/ folder. Please cite the individual parameter entries in the database when used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, upon submission of epiparameter to CRAN, the dual licensing approach was rejected. The CRAN package reviewer stated:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A package can only be licensed as a whole. It can have a single license or a set of <em>alternative</em> licenes. If the data have to be licensed differently then the code, you have to provide the data in a separate data package with the other license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we decided to separate the data, originally stored in epiparameter, into a package called <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameterDB"><strong>epiparameterDB</strong></a>. This package is solely <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameterDB/blob/main/DESCRIPTION#L15">licensed under CC0</a>, and epiparameter can then also be solely <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/main/DESCRIPTION#L28">licensed under MIT</a>. Both packages are now hosted on CRAN using a single license dedicated to code or data.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">

<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>It is often desirable to host an R package on CRAN as it enables it to be easily installed (from binary if on Mac or Windows), it gives the package some validity as a non-trivial and secure piece of software to install and use.</p>
<p>It is not necessary nor beneficial for all R packages to be hosted on CRAN, and it does come with some drawbacks, such as the dual licensing restriction of code and data, but for our case with the epiparameter package, we deemed it better to host on CRAN and split the code and data into epiparameter and epiparameterDB, respectively.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When including data in your R package from other sources it is important to check that the license of your package and the data is compatible<sup>1</sup>, or that the individual data license is clearly stated, as in igraphdata. For epiparameterDB, we consider model estimates as facts (that is, not copyrightable).</p>
<hr>
<p>This blogpost provides an addendum to our original post <a href="data-licensing.html">Dual licensing R packages with code and data</a>, providing our experience and outcomes from submitting epiparameter – and the resulting epiparmeterDB package – to CRAN in a conformant manner. In addition to the requirements and benefits of open source licensing of open software and data in the first post, we hope this follow-up post provides practical information that will be of use to other R package developers, or software developers and open data curators more broadly.</p>

<p>We are very excited to announce the release of a new <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter">epiparameter</a> version v0.4.0. This is the first version of epiparameter to be on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=epiparameter">CRAN</a> (the package can now be installed with <code>install.packages()</code>). Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.</p>
<p>The fourth minor release of the {epiparameter} focuses on splitting the code and data, with the data being moved into a separate R package: <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=epiparameterDB">{epiparameterDB}</a>. There are also some minor additional improvements focusing on printing and plotting.</p>
<section id="new-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features">New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>The library of epidemiological parameters (<code>parameters.json</code>) has been removed from the {epiparameter} package and moved to the {epiparameterDB} R package which is taken on as a dependency. The {epiparameter} package is licensed solely as MIT with dual licensing with CC0 removed (#415).</li>
<li>The data dictionary (<code>data_dictionary.json</code>) and JSON validation workflow (<code>validate-json.yaml</code>) have been removed from the package (#415).</li>
<li>The library of epidemiological parameters is cached (using <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cachem">{cachem}</a>) on loading the package to reduce the runtime of <code>epiparameter_db()</code> (#417).</li>
<li>The <code>print()</code> and <code>format()</code> methods for the <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> class have been improved to show the units of parameter estimates, as well as summary statistics, if available, for unparameterised <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> objects (#419).</li>
<li><code>on.exit()</code> is no longer called in plotting functions to allow user-specified graphical parameters to not be overwritten (#420).</li>
<li>A <code>plot()</code> method for the <code>&lt;multi_epiparameter&gt;</code> class is added. This enables a list of <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> objects with continuous distributions to be compared on a single plot (#425).</li>
<li>A <code>lines()</code> method for the <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> class is added (#425).</li>

  <title>How well prepared are we to rapidly analyse a new influenza pandemic? A brief perspective on analysis conducted for UK government advisory groups during COVID-19</title>
  <dc:creator>Adam Kucharski</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/covid-analysis/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4frpQJMfn8">multiple reports</a> of influenza H5N1 cases that have no clear animal exposure, it is useful to consider what kinds of analysis would be required in the event of a new influenza pandemic, and how easily this could be performed. As a starting point, this post reflects on some of the real-time work my colleagues and I contributed to inform the UK response to COVID-19.</p>
<section id="reflections-on-covid-19-contributions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-on-covid-19-contributions">Reflections on COVID-19 Contributions</h2>
<p>During COVID-19, academic participants like myself in the UK contributed analysis to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response-membership/list-of-participants-of-sage-and-related-sub-groups">SPI-M-O advisory group</a>, which focused on epidemiology and modelling. This was a subgroup of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-sage-and-covid-19/about-sage-and-covid-19">Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a>.</p>
<p>These contributions typically fell into two main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports in response to specific questions from the Secretariat (e.g.&nbsp;exploring implications of policy options).</li>
<li>Reports or preliminary results detailing broader epidemiological insights about COVID-19 my colleagues and I thought were noteworthy (e.g.&nbsp;unusual patterns with novel variants).</li>
</ul>
<p>This post focuses on the analysis reports that I made a major contribution to as a member of SPI-M-O in the first 18 months after COVID was identified as a threat, i.e.&nbsp;between Jan 2020 and July 2021 (a full list has <a href="https://www.covid19.public-inquiry.uk/documents/inq000056464-rule-9-questionnaire-response-from-prof-adam-kucharski-scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-scientific-pandemic-influenza-group-on-modelling-spi-m-o-undated/">previously been published</a>). Narrative reports or analysis that did not involve substantial analytics or modelling (e.g.&nbsp;just direct plots of data) are not included here. I also include some major early piece of analysis that did not form SPI-M-O reports, but were published and informed subsequent analysis and modelling.</p>
<p>If another pandemic were to hit, how easily and quickly could we do these analyses again? To document where we currently are, it is important to understand where potential gaps and bottlenecks are. For each report, I therefore review three main criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Code availability</strong>: is the original analysis code public? (With link if relevant, or context if not.)</li>
<li><strong>Package availability</strong>: is the analysis code or underlying method currently packaged up for easy reuse?</li>
<li><strong>Task readiness time</strong>: roughly how long would it take to get the code or package into a rough state where it could re-run an equivalent analysis using the characteristics of a future transmissible H5N1 influenza? And how long to do so while also following robust best practice <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/blueprints/">Epiverse-TRACE development principles</a>, so others can easily build on the analysis? Would it take minutes (i.e.&nbsp;possible to run immediately), hours, days or weeks to get the basic functionality working?</li>
</ol>
<p>Criteria (1) and (2) are either marked as available (✅), not available (❌), or partially available (⏳). Time taken is also divided into ‘rough’ (rapid, imperfect code to deliver a task) and ‘robust’ (i.e.&nbsp;best practice development for future re-use) to reflect wider discussions about <a href="https://samabbott.co.uk/posts/2022-09-19-80-percent-good-enough/">what constitutes ‘good enough’ work in a pandemic</a>. I also suggest some areas for potential further development, or links to ongoing development that will enable easier completion of tasks in future. The focus of the post tends to be packages that sit on the CMMID, Epiverse-TRACE, Epiforecasts or my GitHub repositories, because these were most directly related to the tasks being discussed, but some wider packages are also signposted.</p>
<p>This is not an exclusive list of work performed by myself and colleagues in the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at LSHTM; there is a larger <a href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/">CMMID repository of real-time work</a>, as well as a large volume of published papers in academic journals and reports on the gov.uk website. However, I hope this initial post can provide a useful summary of tasks that were performed, and framework for evaluating wider efforts required for a pandemic.</p>
<p>The overall effectiveness of the UK response, and which areas could be strengthened, are topics currently being examined by the COVID Inquiry, and will not be covered here. If readers are interested, there are some broader reflections from members of the UK modelling community, and recommendations for improvements, in <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.19601.1">Sherratt et al, 2024, Wellcome Open Research</a>.</p>
<section id="jan-2020-early-estimation-of-transmissibility-and-control" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jan-2020-early-estimation-of-transmissibility-and-control">28 Jan 2020: Early estimation of transmissibility and control</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adamkucharski/2020-ncov">Code</a> ✅ | Package ⏳ | Days (rough), Weeks (robust)</p>
<p>This analysis in early 2020 focused on estimation of transmissiblity and subsequent effect of lockdown control measures, and brought together reported cases in China, exported cases identified internationally, and infections detected on evacuation flights. A stochastic SEIR model was fitted with sequential Monte Carlo to estimate how <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t"> varied over time, to distinguish between an epidemic that ended because of control vs immunity. Later published as <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1473-3099(20)30144-4/fulltext">Kucharski et al, Lancet Inf Dis, 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The code used to generate estimates for the probability of a large outbreak given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0"> are now available in the Epiverse-TRACE <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/">{superspreading}</a> package.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested or ongoing development:</strong> There are now much more efficient methods for performing the main real-time inference analysis, particularly the <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/dust">{dust}</a> toolkit in combination with <a href="https://mrc-ide.github.io/mcstate/">{mcstate}</a>. As future tools will have to be flexible enough to be applicable in a wide range of modelling scenarios with different data sources, the main ongoing task is to ensure these are well documented and have been tested with relevant examples that can serve as templates for future work. The <a href="https://github.com/LloydChapman/seir">{seir} package</a> is collating a library of simple model fitting implementations and a <a href="https://github.com/LloydChapman/seir/tree/early-wuhan">branch</a> has implemented estimation of a fixed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0"> value in an SEIR model using early exported COVID cases. The next step would be to implement an example with a time-varying reproduction number.</p>

<section id="feb-2020-early-analysis-of-contact-tracing-effectiveness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feb-2020-early-analysis-of-contact-tracing-effectiveness">2 Feb 2020: Early analysis of contact tracing effectiveness</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cmmid/ringbp">Code</a> ✅ | <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/ringbp">Package</a> ✅ | Hours (rough), Days (robust)</p>
<p>Another early analysis was a paper for SPI-M-O: <strong>Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts</strong>, later published as <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2214-109X(20)30074-7/fulltext">Hellewell et al, Lancet Global Health (2020)</a>. It used a branching process model to explore how transmission (e.g.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0"> and % presymptomatic transmission) and control parameters (e.g.&nbsp;% contacts traced) could influence the risk of a large outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested or ongoing development:</strong> There are several issues on the <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/ringbp">{ringbp}</a> package repo that, once complete, would allow for faster implementation for new pathogens, especially in combination with <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/">{epiparameter}</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/epi.branch.sim/">{epi.branch.sim}</a> package, which is based on the Hellewell et al paper, also offers an arguably more developed package for plug-and-play analysis in the meantime. The <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/">{epichains}</a> package also allows for estimation of simpler branching processes (i.e.&nbsp;without targeted control like contact tracing).</p>

<section id="mar-2020-early-estimation-of-severity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mar-2020-early-estimation-of-severity">3 Mar 2020: Early estimation of severity</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thimotei/cCFRDiamondPrincess">Code</a> ✅ | <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/">Package</a> ✅ | Hours (rough), Days (robust)</p>
<p>This analysis estimated the infection and case fatality ratio by age for COVID-19 using age-adjusted data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Later published as <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.12.2000256">Russell et al, Eurosurveillance, 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The methods used for this analysis are now implemented as the Epiverse-TRACE <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/">{cfr}</a> package. There is also a <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/howto/analyses/estimate_severity/cfr-stratified-severity.html">‘how to’ example for age-specific CFR estimation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested or ongoing development:</strong> There are several <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/issues">GitHub issues</a> open that aim to strengthen {cfr}, especially for edge cases (e.g.&nbsp;very high CFR) or uncertainty when estimating underascertainment.</p>
</section>
<section id="mar-2020-pre-covid-social-mixing-patterns" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mar-2020-pre-covid-social-mixing-patterns">11 Mar 2020: pre-COVID social mixing patterns</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754v2.supplementary-material">Data</a> ✅ | Package ❌ | Hours (rough), Days (robust)</p>
<p>Another early paper for SPI-M-O focused on social mixing patterns in the UK from the 2017/18 BBC public science project: <strong>Some results from the BBC project on contact rates by context and age</strong>, later expanded into <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754v2">Klepac et al, MedRxiv, 2020</a>. The underlying contact matrices were made available alongside the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested or ongoing development:</strong> It would be useful to incorporate data into <a href="https://epiforecasts.io/socialmixr/">{socialmixr}</a> to enable easy re-use in R. There is also an <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/finalsize/issues/216">issue to add eigenvector calculation</a>, alongside the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t"> calculation already implemented in the {finalsize} package, to illustrate which age groups drive early epidemic growth. There is also an <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/tutorials-late/pull/63">incoming training episode</a> on contact matrices.</p>
</section>
<section id="mar-2020-onwards-early-population-level-scenarios" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mar-2020-onwards-early-population-level-scenarios">3 Mar 2020 onwards: Early population-level scenarios</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cmmid/covid-uk">Code</a> ✅ | Package ✅ | Hours (rough), Days (robust)</p>
<p>A collection of population-level scenario modelling reports generated between February and April 2020 was later published as a summary paper, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30133-X/fulltext">Davies et al, Lancet Public Health, 2020</a>. The original model, known as <code>covidm</code>, had a code base that would be reused for multiple epidemic waves, including novel variants. However, many the basic scenarios can be now be explored using the Epiverse-TRACE <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epidemics/">{epidemics}</a>. In particular, {epidemics} can simulate scenarios with multiple overlapping interventions targeting different age groups, and reflect uncertainty in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0">. A version of this package has already been used to <a href="https://gaza-projections.org/">project future outbreak scenarios in Gaza</a>.</p>
<p>Some further reflections on specific pieces of COVID analysis for SPI-M-O in 2020 are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 March. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-effect-of-social-distance-measures-on-deaths-and-peak-demand-for-hospital-services-in-england-3-march-2020"><strong>Effect of social distancing measures on deaths &amp; peak demand for hospitals in England.</strong></a> <strong>Suggested or ongoing development:</strong> Although {epidemics} is set up to simulate infections, there is currently no database for burden to draw on (e.g.&nbsp;easy conversion to hospitalisations and deaths). The WHO Hub <a href="https://github.com/WHO-Collaboratory/simex">simex model</a> has some functions for converting COVID cases to disease outcomes, but this could be a useful feature to include for a wider range of pathogens. Burden estimation is also planned in the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/tutorials-late/issues/54">Epiverse-TRACE late stage tutorials</a>.</li>
<li>8 March. <strong>Estimating the impact of regional triggers for COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions.</strong></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Suggested or ongoing development:</strong> There is work in progress with {epidemics} to allow a more flexible and editable <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epidemics/issues/254">{odin} back end</a>, in case different features are required in future. This will have the advantage of combining the plug-and-play ability to rapidly define age-specific contact structure, demography, parameter uncertainty and overlapping interventions using {epidemics} syntax with a fast and adaptable {odin} simulation model.</p>

The original model was in R, and was later converted into a <a href="https://github.com/rs-delve/tti-explorer">Python library</a> as part of the Royal Society Delve initiative, feeding in to <a href="https://rs-delve.github.io/reports/2020/05/27/test-trace-isolate.html">follow up analysis</a>. This was a rapidly developed bespoke model with multiple types of contact (e.g.&nbsp;home, school, work, other) and an approximated transmission dynamic rather than full simulation (i.e.&nbsp;if 50% of infectious contacts are traced half-way through their likely infectious period, it would cut <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R"> by 25%).</p>
<p><strong>Suggested or ongoing development:</strong> For a future epidemic, it may be more useful to merge these concepts into two types of tool, building on succesful outputs for COVID: 1) a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0276">‘ready reckoners’</a> method that shows very intuitively how contact changes influence overall <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R"> (this could make use of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R"> functionality in{finalsize}), and 2) a more comprehensive model of isolation and quarantine, like the prospective <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epinetwork/">{epinetwork}</a> package.</p>

<p>This collection of reports for SPI-M-O/SAGE analysed the transmission dynamics of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in the UK, untangling imported infections from community transmission. The real-time model was coded in R, with fitting via MLE and then MCMC (as parameter space increased), with a <a href="https://github.com/seabbs/covid-import-model/blob/main/stan/model.stan">stan prototype of the model</a> also developed by Sam Abbott.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Suggested or ongoing development:</strong> The current code base is tailored to COVID-19, but the broader issue of distinguishing external importations (which may be known to some extent, e.g.&nbsp;based on timing of travel ban) from domestic human-to-human transmission also comes up for infections like avian influenza and mpox. If cases can be disaggregated into imported or domestic origin, then {EpiEstim} can calculate domestic transmission based on these data (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2019.100356">Thompson et al, Epidemics, 2019</a>). However, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t"> estimation packages based on renewal processes, like {EpiEstim} and {EpiNow2} are not structured to infer such dynamics if the exact number of importations are unknown, so in future it may be useful to have a framework that builds on the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/78089">Golding et al two component approach</a> developed for the Australian COVID response (accompanying <a href="https://github.com/goldingn/covid19_australia_interventions">code here</a>).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>Code was generally made available alongside public reports by LSHTM during COVID-19, except for very simple calculations. Several key functions are now available in R packages developed since the emergence of COVID-19, turning tasks that would have taken days into tasks that require only hours, but there are still some remaining bottlenecks to ensure that the methods would be applicable easily to H5N1, meaning some customised tasks for pandemic influenza would take hours when - with some further refinement - they could take minutes.</p>

  <title>How we work: My first full package review</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>At Epiverse-TRACE, we continuously develop packages, which risks making us (hyper)focused on the everyday changes. Feature here, bug fix there. We can call this “development by Pull Request,” where we introduce changes in relatively small batches, compared to general development without compartmentalization. Of course, it is a developer’s responsibility to also take into consideration the entire codebase. However, to sometimes enforce taking that step back, <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/blueprints/code-review.html#full-package-review">our contribution blueprints outline that we do full package reviews</a>. In this blog post, I highlight what a full package review is, how it is set up, and some of my experiences with this process.</p>

<p>In the “How we work” series, Epiverse-TRACE contributors share how they work. This does not necessarily reflect a standardized way of working, and helps highlight how diverse coding practices can be.</p>

<section id="what-is-a-full-package-review" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-full-package-review">What is a full package review?</h2>
<p>You may not be surprised to hear that a full package review covers every part of a package ever written. This means the entire current codebase is in scope, from day one of development. It does not necessitate reviewing the entire commit history per se, focussing on the package as it stands at that time. As a maintainer that can be scary, because it can include code you did not write yourself, and may not know how to justify (at least that is what happens for me).</p>
<p>Our regular code reviews take place on GitHub, using Pull Requests. For full package reviews, we also use Pull Requests in Epiverse-TRACE. This means that all the features from GitHub are available to make suggestions, approve the code, or leave precise comments at a specific line in the code.</p>
<p>What is different, is that all the files are considered new, and part of the review. This includes the files already present in our <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/packagetemplate">package template</a>, but also all test files, documentation, and more. A full package review is usually triggered by an upcoming release, either on GitHub or CRAN.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-i-set-one-up">How do I set one up?</h2>
<p>Git and GitHub do not support full package reviews by default. This is because pull requests are usually merged into an existing branch, which already contains existing code. For a full package review, what we want is to merge onto an empty branch.</p>
<p>In order to create a branch that has no code at all, run the following shell command from within your git directory:</p>

<p>These commands are also noted in the blueprints, but I simplified them so that you do not need to copy paste the hash of the first commit. Also, you can use this command for any Git repository and open up the pull request through GitHub (or Gitlab, Forgejo). This means that doing a full package review can be done anywhere, anytime.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-experience-of-a-full-package-review">The experience of a full package review</h2>
<p><a href="../../posts/chjh-intro-blog/index.html">Since joining Epiverse-TRACE</a>, I participated in many full package reviews, but did not until quite recently initiate my own. For the new package <strong>safeframe</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/safeframe/pull/40">I recently requested a full package review</a>. This highlighted two quirks I did not realize before.</p>
<p>First, it feels like doing something that can easily go wrong. I have been using Git for over a decade<sup>1</sup>, but this was completely new to me. Given that git operations can sometimes cause issues, I was hesitant to just run the shell commands. Maybe having a demo video showing it works, will help contributors gain confidence in doing this.</p>
<p>Second, reviewer suggestions are great, but getting them on a full package review involves manual work to include them. I try to leave actionable suggestions directly in the code when I review, so they are easy to accept and integrate into the codebase. With full package reviews, receiving suggestions became slightly annoying. Not because of the reviewer, but because the suggestions have to be manually recreated in a separate branch that will actually be merged. It would be great if we had a way to keep the ease of integrating reviewer suggestions in full package reviews.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, full package reviews are a helpful way to take a step back and take in the big picture. It is a great moment to get feedback from Epiverse-TRACE developers and discuss how the package fits in to the ecosystem. It also comes with some quirks, as I outlined, which I would like to find ways to address.</p>
<p>I would be interested to hear other developer’s experiences with full package reviews in the comments!</p>

  <title>vaccineff v1.0.0</title>
  <dc:creator>The Epiverse-TRACE development team</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/vaccineff_v1.0.0/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We are very excited to announce the release of a new <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/vaccineff/">vaccineff</a> version v1.0.0. The package offers tools for estimating vaccine effectiveness (VE) and related metrics, with features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimation in a cohort study design via the Cox model for Proportional Hazards<br>
</li>
<li>Controlling for confounders through an iterative matching algorithm<br>
</li>
<li>A detailed vignette with illustrative examples</li>
</ul>
<p>Two main functions compose <code>{vaccineff 1.0.0}</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>make_vaccineff_data()</code>: Constructs the <code>vaccineff_data</code> class, managing key features for preparing, visualizing, and organizing cohort data.</p></li>
<li><p><code>estimate_vaccineff()</code>: Constructs the <code>vaccineff</code> class, enabling estimation of VE and assessment of results and model performance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both classes support <code>plot()</code> and <code>summary()</code> methods, providing visualizations and detailed reports.</p>
<section id="breaking-changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h2>
<p><code>{vaccineff 1.0.0}</code> refactors the package’s internal structure for better maintainability.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>estimate_vaccineff()</code></strong> replaces <code>effectiveness()</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It returns an object of class <code>vaccineff</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>at</code> parameter must always be provided for accurate results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><code>plot.vaccineff_data()</code></strong> replaces <code>plot_coverage()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>cohortdata</code></strong> has been simplified and reduced to improve examples and reduce computation time.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="quick-start" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>
<p>To start with <code>{vaccineff}</code> 1.0.0, run the following example. This example estimates VE using the package’s example dataset, adjusted for confounders (age and sex) via the iterative matching strategy.</p>
<p>The <code>summary()</code> method for the <code>vaccineff_data</code> object provides details on cohort balance and composition before and after applying the matching strategy, as well as general cohort features.</p>
<p>When called on the <code>vaccineff</code> object (<code>ve</code>), the <code>summary()</code> method returns the estimation summary, including results from the Schoenfeld test for proportional hazards.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We are very excited to announce the release of a new epiparameter version v0.3.0. Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.</p>
<p>The third minor release of the {epiparameter} R package contains a range of updates and improvements to the package. The principal aim of this release is to simplify, clarify and enhance the classes and class methods when working with epidemiological parameters in R.</p>
<p>The are a large number of <strong><em>breaking changes</em></strong> in this release, primarily functions and function arguments being renamed or restructured, see the <em>Breaking changes</em> section for an overview.</p>
<section id="new-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features">New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>The library of epidemiological parameters has been updated to include 3 new Chikungunya parameter entries. The Mpox parameters previously missing from the Guzzetta et al.&nbsp;entry have been added (#346 &amp; #374).</li>
<li>A <code>c()</code> method has been added for <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;multi_epiparameter&gt;</code> objects (#368).</li>
<li>An <code>aggregate()</code> method has been added for <code>&lt;multi_epiparameter&gt;</code> to enable consensus distributions to be built utilising the mixture distribution class from <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distributional">{distributional}</a> (#388).</li>
<li>Infrastructure has been added to the package to allow translations of messages/warnings/errors printed to the console. (<span class="citation" data-cites="Bisaloo">@Bisaloo</span>, #367).</li>
<li><code>convert_summary_stats_to_params()</code> can now convert from median and dispersion for a lognormal distribution (#378).</li>
<li>The <code>data_dictionary.json</code> has been enhanced to improve validation of the library of epidemiological parameters (<code>parameters.json</code>) (#379).</li>
<li>An interactive network showing all of the <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> S3 methods has been added to the <code>design_principles.Rmd</code> vignette (#383).</li>
<li>The <code>data_from_epireview.Rmd</code> article has been improved and updated with new changes from {epireview} (<span class="citation" data-cites="CarmenTamayo">@CarmenTamayo</span> &amp; <span class="citation" data-cites="cm401">@cm401</span> &amp; <span class="citation" data-cites="kellymccain28">@kellymccain28</span>, #305 &amp; #373).</li>
<li>Parameter units have been added to every entry in the {epiparameter} library (<code>parameters.json</code>) and to the <code>$metadata</code> element in <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> objects. The <code>create_metadata()</code> function now has a <code>units</code> argument to construct metadata lists (#391).</li>
<li>Improved <code>database.Rmd</code> vignette by adding a short citation to the reference column (<span class="citation" data-cites="jamesmbaazam">@jamesmbaazam</span>, #348).</li>
<li>The <code>family()</code> method for <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> has been improved to allow access to distribution names for transformed (e.g.&nbsp;<code>mixture</code> and <code>truncated</code> distributions) and untransformed (e.g.&nbsp;<code>gamma</code> and <code>lognormal</code>) distributions with a new argument <code>base_dist</code> and a new internal function <code>.distributional_family()</code> (#398).</li>
<li><code>as_epiparameter()</code> can now work with the SARS parameters from {epireview} (#407).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="breaking-changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>&lt;epidist&gt;</code> class has been renamed <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> to avoid confusion with the similar R package <a href="https://github.com/epinowcast/epidist">{epidist}</a> (#360).</li>
<li>Many functions that used <code>epidist</code> in their names have been renamed to use <code>epiparameter</code> due to the renaming of the class (#360).</li>
<li>The function signatures of <code>epiparameter()</code> and <code>new_epiparameter()</code> functions (previously <code>epidist()</code> and <code>new_epidist()</code>) have been updated to collapse the <code>prob_dist</code>, <code>prob_dist_params</code>, <code>discretise</code> and <code>truncation</code> arguments into <code>prob_distribution</code>, which accepts the output of <code>create_prob_distribution()</code> (#381).</li>
<li>The <code>epi_dist</code> argument has been renamed <code>epi_name</code>. This is to clarify that {epiparameter} can work with epidemiological parameters that take a variety of forms (e.g.&nbsp;point estimates, ranges, probability distributions, etc.) (#390).</li>
<li>The <code>&lt;vb_epidist&gt;</code> class and it’s methods have been removed from the package. It was not being used and was increasing the complexity and maintenance load of the package (#359).</li>
<li><code>create_prob_dist()</code> has been renamed to <code>create_prob_distribution()</code> (#381).</li>
<li><code>validate_epiparameter()</code> (previously <code>validate_epidist()</code>) has been renamed <code>assert_epiparameter()</code>, and <code>test_epiparameter()</code> has been added, with the aim to harmonise design with <a href="https://github.com/socialcontactdata/contactmatrix">{contactmatrix}</a> and the messages and errors have been improved (#366 &amp; #402).</li>
<li>The minimum version of R required by the package is now 4.1.0 due to the use of the base R pipe (<code>|&gt;</code>) in dependencies, and the R-CMD-check workflow on GitHub actions now explicitly runs on the minimum version of R stated in the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> (#384 &amp; #405).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="bug-fixes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Epidemiological parameter entries in the library stored with lognormal distributions, parameterised as median and dispersion are now converted to meanlog and sdlog correctly when creating an <code>&lt;epiparameter&gt;</code> (when <code>auto_calc_params = TRUE</code>) (#381).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="deprecated-and-defunct" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deprecated-and-defunct">Deprecated and defunct</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>epidist_db()</code> has been deprecated. It is replaced by <code>epiparameter_db()</code> (#360 &amp; #399).</li>

<p>Part of the Epiverse-TRACE initiative involves development of training materials that span early, middle and late stage outbreak analysis and modelling tasks. To ensure that our tutorials are accessible to target audiences, we have developed a series of <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/personas">learner personas</a> to inform the design of learning materials. These personas include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lucia</strong>, a Field Epidemiologist that use R for data cleaning, plotting and report for Outbreak response.</li>
<li><strong>Juan</strong>, a Statistician and R user in a National Health Agency with constant deployment to outbreak response.</li>
<li><strong>Patricia</strong>, a PhD student learning to use R and analyse Outbreak data for her collaborative project on GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Vania</strong>, a professor who needs ready-to-use training for her research and to pass on to students.</li>
<li><strong>Danielle</strong>, a Trainer that wants to remix content to create specific training materials for public health practitioners.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the volume of training materials increases, we have explored automating the generation of initial reviews using large language models (LLMs) that take the form of ‘in character’ agents with instructions to provide constructive comments. This reflects a wider focus within the field of outbreak analytics on how LLMs agents can be used to increase the efficiency and scalability of common tasks (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00104-6/fulltext">van Hoek et al, Lancet Microbe, 2024</a> ).</p>
<p>To generate the AI tutorial reviews, we use the OpenAI GPT-4 API, via the <code>openai</code> R package, as described in <a href="https://github.com/adamkucharski/llm-api-scripts/">this repository</a>. We also use the <code>gh</code> package to load the <code>.Rmd</code> materials from a given repository (e.g.&nbsp;<code>epiverse-trace/tutorials-middle</code>). Full illustrative code is <a href="https://github.com/adamkucharski/llm-api-scripts/blob/main/scripts/content_review_gpt.R">available here</a>, with the GPT-4 API prompts outlined below.</p>

<p>To illustrate the sort of reviews that can be generated with the above approach, the below is the output produced when we imported the <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/vania-academica.html">Vania senior academic persona</a> alongside an early pre-Alpha version of the training materials for our transmissibility estimation tutorial:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Overall, the tutorial is well-structured and provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the <code>EpiNow2</code> package to estimate transmission metrics from case data. However, there are several areas that could be improved to enhance clarity and understanding for learners like me.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: The prerequisites section could be expanded to include specific resources for learners to review the necessary concepts. For instance, links to resources on Bayesian analysis and the effective reproduction number would be helpful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jargon and Terminology</strong>: The tutorial contains several technical terms and jargon that could be confusing for learners. For example, terms like “Bayesian inference”, “posterior probability”, “likelihood”, and “prior probability” are used without clear explanations. Providing definitions or links to resources for these terms would be beneficial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Explanation</strong>: While the tutorial does a good job of explaining what the code does, it could provide more context on why certain functions or packages are used. For instance, it would be helpful to explain why the <code>EpiNow2</code> package is used and how it differs from other packages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visualizations</strong>: Although visualizations are not shown in the Rmd, it would be beneficial to explain what learners should expect to see in the visualizations and how to interpret them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exercises</strong>: The tutorial lacks exercises for learners to practice the concepts and skills they have learned. Including exercises with solutions would greatly enhance the learning experience.</p></li>

<p>Suggestions for improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand the prerequisites section to include specific resources for learners to review necessary concepts.</li>
<li>Provide definitions or links to resources for technical terms and jargon.</li>
<li>Provide more context on why certain functions or packages are used.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overcoming-feedback-bottlenecks">Overcoming feedback bottlenecks</h2>
<p>A challenge with LLMs trained for general use is finding domain-specific tasks where they can add sufficient value beyond existing human input. Tasks like providing early sense checking and tailored feedback, particularly from differing perspectives, therefore has potential to overcome common bottlenecks in developing training materials (e.g.&nbsp;providing initial comments and flagging obvious issues while waiting for more detailed human feedback).</p>
<p>As Epiverse-TRACE training materials continue to develop, we plan to explore further uses beyond simple first-pass reviews. For example, LLMs are well suited to synthesising qualitative feedback, increasing the range of insights that can be collected and summarised from learners as we move into beta testing. We also hope to identify opportunities where LLMs can help supplement the learner experience, as demonstrated by emerging tools like <a href="http://rtutor.ai/">RTutor</a> for descriptive plotting functionality in R, which combines generation of code in response to user queries with translation into shiny outputs.</p>

<section id="licensing-only-code-in-r-packages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="licensing-only-code-in-r-packages">Licensing only code in R packages</h3>
<p>Given the importance of a license for redistribution, CRAN requires R packages to contain an <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-exts.html#Licensing">open-source license</a>.<sup>1</sup> As one of the most important distributors for R packages historically, this rule has become the de facto standard.</p>
<p>An R package is licensed appropriately when the license is stated in the metadata <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file and, if necessary, in the <code>LICENSE</code> file. We recommend including the <code>LICENSE</code> file, with the license year and exact copyright holder (for example, an organization or a specific individual). Some R package developers choose to include a copy of the license but this is <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/license.html#key-files">not bundled in the R package when it is built</a>. You can <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/blob/29ee12aa9b8a49eedb9207d95c25c13d7d4e0ace/DESCRIPTION#L27">find an example of a <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cfr/blob/main/LICENSE">find an example <code>LICENSE</code> here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="licensing-only-data-in-r-packages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="licensing-only-data-in-r-packages">Licensing only data in R packages</h3>
<p>It can be the case that an R package is primarily used to bundle and share a data set, for example to allow a user to easily download the data and load it into R. For example, <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder"><strong>gapminder</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins"><strong>palmerpenguins</strong></a>. As an aside, some in the R developer community<sup>2</sup> dissuade the use of R packages used primarily for data, often referred to as <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/data.html">“data packages”</a>, and instead advocate to host data online and use the several API packages available in R to access the data. <!-- Data packages are often small, openly accessibly data sets that are used to showcase the functionality of a package. In these cases the data is secondary to the code, and as such many of the R packages with these "toy" data sets only state a software license.  --></p>
<p>Software licenses do not apply to data. One piece of data cannot be copyrighted, as facts cannot be copyrighted, but a collection of data in a database can come with rights. In Europe, UK, and Russia, databases can have rights if they are a substantial and original piece of work.<sup>3</sup> This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_right">the “sui generis” database right</a>. The USA and Brazil do not recognize this database right. Data compiled from various databases that themselves are copyrighted would need to follow the licenses of those respective databases.</p>
<p>Data need licenses such as the Public Domain Dedication or the Creative Commons Attribution to maximize redistribution. Such <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/license.html#code-you-write">general licenses</a> help minimize differences among countries that do and do not recognize database rights. Given that any copyright limitations (even attribution) mean they only apply when the database right is recognized, we recommend the most minimal option: The Public Domain Dedication. This levels the playing field for reuse and redistribution, no matter the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>This section on dual licensing was first published in September 2024. Since publishing, the <strong>epiparameter</strong> package is no longer dual licensed due to CRAN requirements.</p>
<p>Please <a href="data-licensing-cran.html#licensing-code-and-data-in-one-r-package">click here to see the updated version of the this section in a new post</a>, which updates the <em>Licensing code and data in one R package</em> section in light of our experience dual licensing an R package and CRAN.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But what to do if your R package has both code and data as primary objects of (roughly) equal importance?</p>
<p>In these cases a software license inadequately covers the data, and a data license inadequately covers the code. Dual licensing can help resolve this issue. This means there is one license for code (for example, MIT license) and another license for the included data (for example, Public Domain Dedication).</p>
<p>After conducting an online search, dual licensing for R packages seems rare. An interesting example of dual licensing is the <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraphdata/blob/main/LICENSE"><strong>igraphdata</strong> package</a>, which contains several licenses: One for each dataset included in the package. Similar to igraphdata, in our own <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter"><strong>epiparameter</strong> package</a> we dual licensed the code and data as well. We <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/4f7008063040fc4a0b436a9e4d2adb9bb7022f6c/DESCRIPTION#L21">licensed the code using the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file</a> and used <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/main/LICENSE">the <code>LICENSE</code> file</a> to license the data under CC0. Concretely, we include this additional text in <code>LICENSE</code> to clarify the dual license and that we recommend citing the original source regardless:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>All data included in the epiparameter R package is licensed under CC0 (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt" class="uri">https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt</a>). This includes the parameter database (extdata/parameters.json) and data in the data/ folder. Please cite the individual parameter entries in the database when used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When including data in your R package from other sources it is important to check that the license of your package and the data is compatible<sup>4</sup>, or that the individual data license is clearly stated, as in igraphdata. For epiparameter, we consider model estimates as facts (that is, not copyrightable).</p>
<hr>
<p>This blogpost helps explain a pattern of dual licensing rarely seen in the wild, and how to implement it in a CRAN conformant manner. By sharing this, we hope that those cases where people want to license both code and data, have a resource we wish we had while exploring this topic. Whether or not data packages and combined code + data packages should exist, is a question for another day.</p>

The <code>as_epidist.data.frame()</code> method is added, as well as the internal functions <code>is_epireview()</code> which determines if a <code>&lt;data.frame&gt;</code> is from {epireview}, and <code>epireview_to_epidist()</code> performs the conversion (#298, #334 &amp; #335)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>epireview_core_cols.rda</code> data is added to the package. This is used to determine whether the input to <code>as_epidist.data.frame()</code> is a parameter table from {epireview} as these objects do not have a recognisable class attribute (#298).</p></li>
<li><p>A new website only vignette (i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://r-pkgs.org/vignettes.html#sec-vignettes-article">article</a>) <code>data_from_epireview.Rmd</code> is added that explains how to use <code>as_epidist()</code> with data from {epireview} (#298 &amp; #335).</p></li>
<li><p>A new vignette <code>database.Rmd</code> is added to the package to provide a web interface to the {epiparameter} library of epidemiological parameters. Contributed by <span class="citation" data-cites="sbfnk">@sbfnk</span> (#311).</p></li>
<li><p>The plotting method for <code>&lt;epidist&gt;</code> objects (<code>plot.epidist()</code>) has been improved to better differentiate continuous from discrete or discretised distributions (#315).</p></li>
<li><p><code>epidist_db(..., single_epidist = TRUE)</code> now prioritises parameter entries that account for right truncation (#323).</p></li>
<li><p><code>create_epidist_prob_dist()</code> (previously named <code>create_prob_dist()</code>) is now exported and enables more control of discretisation settings by allowing arguments to be passed to <code>distcrete::distcrete()</code> via <code>...</code> (#324).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>&lt;multi_epidist&gt;</code> print method (<code>print.multi_epidist()</code>) has been improved to provides object information in the print header, the first few elements of the list or all elements if list is short, and some extra links and advice in the print footer. The design of the print method follows the design pattern of <a href="https://pillar.r-lib.org/index.html">{pillar}</a> (#326).</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;epidist&gt;</code> objects and functions that work with <code>&lt;epidist&gt;</code> objects now work with exponential distributions (#333).</p></li>
<li><p>The package now has an explicit data license: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt">CC0</a> in the <code>LICENSE</code> file.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><code>list_distributions()</code> has been replaced by <code>parameter_tbl()</code> which enhances the printing by leveraging {pillar} (#321).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>&lt;vb_epidist&gt;</code> plotting method (<code>plot.vb_epidist()</code>) has been removed from the package. This provided minimal functionality and was unnecessarily complicating the function signature of <code>plot.epidist()</code> (#315).</p></li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>GitHub recently previewed <a href="https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/">‘Copilot Workspace’</a>, which aims to use generative AI to assist software developers. Rather than just giving in-line suggestions, as GitHub copilot does, workspace allows users to map out and execute entire projects. We got early preview access to the tool, so decided to see how well it performed for our needs in Epiverse-TRACE.</p>
<p>In the Epiverse-TRACE initiative we aim to develop an ecosystem of epidemic analytics tools as <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods</a> in the form of R packages. We aim to <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/blueprints/">follow best-practices</a> given that our tools will be used to inform public health decisions. For efficiency, we use a range of development tools, including integrated development environments (IDE), such as RStudio and Visual Studio Code, other R packages to help check and document our code, for example {lintr} and {roxygen2}, and version control and code sharing tools, git and GitHub.</p>
<p>Given the rapid development and increasing availability to artificial intelligence (AI) models, specifically large language models, offer the potential to be another development tool to add to the arsenal of researchers and software engineers to enhance productivity and improve the reliability of the code we write and others depend upon <span class="citation" data-cites="vanHoek2024">(Hoek et al. 2024)</span>. Large language models like ChatGPT from OpenAI, Gemini from Google, Claude from Anthropic, as well as many others and new ones frequently appearing, have presented opportunities to quickly generate material – text, code and images – from text prompts.</p>
<p>A small group of Epiverse-TRACE professors and research software engineers decided to explore the suitability of one such, GitHub Copilot integrated with GitHub Workspaces, for some typical use cases encountered in our day-to-day work. We do note that many other such tools are available, and we chose Copilot in Workspaces as our code is hosted on GitHub, making for easy evaluation of the specific contribution of the AI tool. However, some of our broad conclusions are based on using other tools for similar tasks.</p>
<p>The aim of this blog post is to summarise our experiences with Copilot and Workspaces, and share our thoughts more generally about how the current feature set of AI-powered development tools could help with our daily development tasks, and with research software development at large. We evaluated Copilot workspace across three tasks of varying difficulty and requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Experiment 1: Exporting an R function by updating the documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 2: Adding a basic epidemic model to an existing R package that contains other epidemiological models</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 3: Conducting a code review on an R package</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first experiment was on the {EpiNow2} R package. An existing <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2/issues/681">Issue #681</a> was chosen. It was a simple task to evaluate Copilot workspace’s ability to interpret requests that require small changes to the codebase of a package (i.e.&nbsp;can be achieved in a single commit by changing less than 5 lines of code). The issue stated that an internal function, <code>epinow2_cmdstan_model()</code> should be exported, with the issue description explaining this would help users specify custom options for running the models.</p>

<section id="outcome" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
<p>The specification provided by Copilot workspace diagnosed the issue requirements, mentioning that the <code>NAMESPACE</code> file, which stores information on functions offered by a package and functions imported from other packages, would have to be updated for the R package to export this currently unexported function. The proposed solution also addressed the desired changes, stating that the function was to be exported and the keyword <code>internal</code> would be removed. The automatically generated plan proposed to edit the file documentation and <code>NAMESPACE</code>, but we edited this to more specifically replace the <code>@keyword internal</code> {roxygen} tag with <code>@export</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-thoughts">Our thoughts</h3>
<p>The implementation offered by GitHub copilot workspace was correct and replaced <code>@keywords internal</code> with <code>@export</code> in the correct function documentation <code>epinow2_stan_model()</code>.</p>
<p>However, it also changed the formatting of one of the function arguments (<code>@param model</code>) by moving some text to the next line and added a comma to the last but one item listed in the sentence. (It seems AI has taken a side on the Oxford comma debate).</p>
<p>Overall, this test case of GitHub copilot workspace was a partial success. It correctly recognised the links between inline R function documentation, Roxygen tags, and the R-specific documentation files in <code>man/</code>. However, it (naturally) does not have a mechanistic understanding of package development and how changing tags in documentation is used to auto-update doc files using development tools. It correctly modified the part of the file needed to export an internal function. This showcases an example of where this technology can be beneficial: those new to a language or paradigm that have not yet picked up all of the development details that are often second nature to experienced developers. In this example, the time taken to make this change in GitHub copilot workspace was likely ~10x longer than what our RSEs would take. However, if someone was used to developing in say, Python, and was new to the conventions of exporting functions in R using {roxygen} documentation, this test case shows how copilot workspace can reliably assist. On the other hand, because these changes make no reference to standard development tools, they would not help new developers learn how or where to use them.</p>
<p>The changes made will still require the user to manually run the documentation (using either <code>devtools::document()</code> or <code>roxygen2::roxygenize()</code>) to update the package <code>NAMESPACE</code> for the function to be exported. Our recommendation would be for AI tools to integrate with and call development tools used by developers (analogous to pre-commit hooks running tools before committing) to make sure this is taken care of all in a single generative step.</p>

<p>{epidemics} is an Epiverse-TRACE R package that exports a range of compartmental epidemiological models of varying complexities and applications.</p>
<p>In the second test case, we created an issue in the {epidemics} R package requesting a basic SIR model, with the issue description requesting the model to have no age structure and to use existing functionality in the package to specify a disease intervention. Additionally, the issue requested that the model be solved with the {deSolve} R package, which is a differential equation solver in R. A basic SIR model would have been new to the package, but one of several other compartmental models, and simpler than the models already implemented.</p>

</div>
<section id="outcome-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outcome-1">Outcome</h3>
<p>GitHub copilot workspace outlined the existing functionality in the package and proposed changes including adding a new file called <code>R/model_sir.R</code>, which follows the <code>model_*.R</code> naming convention used in {epidemics}. As requested, copilot also proposed that the new SIR model would support the use of interventions that are already been implemented in the package.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-thoughts-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-thoughts-1">Our thoughts</h3>
<p>The code generated was an R function that constructed a basic SIR model, and this was well documented using a {roxygen2} documentation block. However, several aspects of the code generated did not match the proposal generated by copilot workspace, and the code contained inadvisable coding practices in R (i.e.&nbsp;code smells). Firstly the SIR model itself. The model implemented follows the standard set of differential equations that are solved using {deSolve}, as requested in our prompt. However, the model does not have any options to input interventions, which the proposed solution by GitHub copilot workspace suggested it would. The second downside is the use of <code>require(deSolve)</code> in the function body of the generated code. This is bad practice in R package development as functions should namespace any functions that are being called from other packages (e.g.&nbsp;<code>packagename::func_name()</code>).</p>
<p>This task required copilot workspace to understand the contents and conventions of the {epidemics} R package and generate a simple compartmental model which would integrate with the infrastructure in the package for defining interventions in models. Although it correctly summarised the package contents, its attempt to answer the specific request from our prompt had many inaccuracies. The generated code is likely influenced by the many examples of SIR models written in R on the internet and on GitHub. These might be R scripts or gists and thus coding practises used there are not always appropriate for writing code to be distributed in an R package, resulting in decisions like having <code>require(deSolve)</code> in the function.</p>
<p>AI-generated code like that seen in this example showcases where users need to be diligent and not assume that the text descriptions from copilot match the code. In the end, this was a test example and was unlikely to be merged into {epidemics} even if the code was correct. However, with the code generated, it presents almost no use; it would require as much time for an RSE to refactor this function as it would to write one from scratch following the design principles and demands of the {epidemics} package.</p>

<p>In the last test case, we requested GitHub copilot workspace to conduct a <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist/pull/117">code review of the entire code base of a package</a>. At Epiverse-TRACE, it is standard practise to conduct a full package review. As any code base develops, including R packages, more commits are added and often the number of lines of code increases. Reviewing all of these changes before releasing a new version of the package is a timely undertaking for package reviewers. If AI tools could review the code base, similar to how static code analysers work, and suggest improvements to, for example, code style, memory efficiency, documentation, unit testing, UX/UI, it would greatly improve efficiency before releasing the code.</p>
<section id="outcome-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outcome-2">Outcome</h3>
<p>Here, Copilot provided no analysis of the code base. It regurgitated the changes described in the <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/blueprints/code-review.html#full-package-review">package review pull request</a>, likely from a mix of the pull request description and the changelog (<code>NEWS.md</code> file), and did not analyse any of the code. Therefore, it provided no additional use than if the reviewer had just read the <code>NEWS</code>.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on our trials we observe that GitHub copilot Workspace may not provide a significant benefit to research software engineers in domain-specific R package development, where problems are complex and bespoke solutions are common. The evidence above suggests there’s still a long way to go before AI-powered tools can produce unsupervised code projects equivalent to that of a research software engineer. One observation is that generative AI is better trained for some purposes than others, biased by the amount of training data/information available. This makes it struggle in niche areas with a relatively smaller public code base to train models with (e.g.&nbsp;R functions for epidemic analysis are much rarer than generic JavaScript functions for web design). A second is that AI models don’t seem to understand how different parts of a codebase link together, so they provide solutions that are inconsistent with the requirements of the codebase (design principles, code style, etc). These models may, however, be more useful for more common tasks, such as building dashboard templates.</p>
<p>The test cases we experimented with suggest that this tool will not replace, and at times not even enhance development when the task requires a more integrated development than generating a standalone script. These tools are evolving rapidly and we are sure improvements will continue. In the short term tools like GitHub copilot workspace need to be used responsibly with an awareness of their limitations and not a blind trust that the code it writes is always correct. We would caution against relying on generative AI tools alone to develop software with potentially large-scale impacts - scrutiny by trained developers is still key. Research software engineers will play a key part in this as they will ensure that code and software written with and by AI tools meet required standards, are trustworthy, and are not potentially harmful. Where we see generative AI tools being more immediately useful in research software development is in <a href="https://billyquilty.substack.com/p/llmlinelist-enabling-rapid-outbreak">tasks that require sifting through or summarising vast amounts of information</a>; for example, in querying software documentation, or to help get started with a new programming framework or language.</p>

  <title>Improving Ecosystem Interoperability Iteratively via Progressive Enhancement</title>
  <dc:creator>Hugo Gruson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/progressive-enhancement/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We are continuing our post series on S3 object orientation and interoperability in R. We have previously discussed <a href="../parent-class">what makes a good S3 class and how to choose a good parent for it, as well as when to write or not write a custom method</a>. We have highlighted in particular how classes inheriting from data.frames can simplify user experience because of familiarity, and reduce developer workload due to the pre-existing S3 methods.</p>
<p>We have detailed how to improve compatibility with the tidyverse by explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hugogruson.fr/posts/compa-tibble/">how functions taking data.frames or data.frames subclass should also allow compatibility with tibble, which can be done in a few steps</a></li>
<li><a href="../extend-dataframes">how to ensure class attributes are preserved whenever possible while using dplyr functions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we are going to explore how to start adding support in the ecosystem for the new S3 classes while minimizing user-facing breaking changes. We have previously delved into this topic with our post <a href="../s3-generic">“Convert Your R Function to an S3 Generic: Benefits, Pitfalls &amp; Design Considerations”</a> and this is a wider and higher-level view of the same topic.</p>
<p>The strategy presented here is the variation of a common concept in web development and the web ecosystem: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>. This philosophy aims to support browsers with a common set of essential features, and even richer features for browser with the most recent updates. It makes sense to think about this philosophy with the prism of introducing new classes to a new software ecosystem as it has the similar constraints of multiple stakeholders with different interests and timelines. The application of progressive enhancement in this context means that users or packages that have not (yet) adopted the new classes are not penalized compared to users or packages that have.</p>
<section id="adding-class-support-to-function-inputs-via-progressive-enhancement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-class-support-to-function-inputs-via-progressive-enhancement">Adding class support to function inputs via progressive enhancement</h2>
<p>The goal here is to allow functions to accept the new classes as inputs, while keeping the old behaviour unchanged for unclassed objects (or with a different class than the new one).</p>
<p>This can conveniently be done in an almost transparent way by converting the old function to the S3 generic, and using the default method to handle the old behaviour. The practical steps, and minor caveats, have been previously described in the post <a href="../s3-generic">“Convert Your R Function to an S3 Generic: Benefits, Pitfalls &amp; Design Considerations”</a>.</p>

<p>For a different, additional, example, we can consider a function working on patient-level data, which previously only accepted a <code>data.frame</code> as input:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<p>We want to add support for <code>linelist</code> objects, as defined in the <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/linelist">linelist package</a>. <code>linelist</code> objects inherit from <code>data.frame</code> and contain an additional <code>tags</code> attribute. In particular, <code>linelist</code> objects can have a <code>date_admission</code> and <code>date_discharge</code> tag. This means we can use the tags to automatically detect the columns to use.</p>
<p>But we want the function to keep working for standard <code>data.frame</code>s, <code>tibble</code>s, etc. We can follow the steps described in the previous post to convert the function to a generic, and add a default method to handle the old behaviour:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-class-support-to-function-outputs-via-progressive-enhancement">Adding class support to function outputs via progressive enhancement</h2>
<p>Adding class support to function outputs is often more challenging. A common option is to add a new argument to the function, which would be a boolean indicating whether the output should be of the new class or not. But this doesn’t fit in the view of progressive enhancement, as it would require users to change their code to benefit from the new classes, or to suffer from breaking changes.</p>
<p>While the new argument approach is sometimes indeed the only possible method, there are some situations where we can have an approach truly following the progressive enhancement philosophy.</p>
<p>In particular, this is the case when the old output was already inheriting from the parent of the new class (hence the importance of carefully choosing the parent class). In this situation, the new attributes from the new class should not interfere with existing code for downstream analysis.</p>
<p>In this case, let’s consider a function that was previously returning an unclassed <code>data.frame</code> with patient-level data:</p>

<p>For a more realistic example, you can also see the work in progress to integrate the <a href="https://github.com/socialcontactdata/contactmatrix">new <code>contactmatrix</code> standard format</a> for social contact data to the <a href="https://github.com/Bisaloo/contactdata">contactdata package</a>.</p>
<p>This is however only true if code in downstream analysis follows good practices in checking for the class of an object <sup>1</sup>. If existing code was testing equality of the class to a certain value, it will break when the new class value is appended. This is described in a <a href="https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/11/09/when-you-think-class.-think-again/index.html">post on the R developer blog, when base R was adding a new <code>array</code> class value to <code>matrix</code> objects</a>. Class inheritance should never be tested via <code>class(x) == "some_class"</code>. Instead, <code>inherits(x, "some_class")</code> or <code>is(x, "some_class")</code> should be used to future-proof the code and allow appending an additional in the future.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Object oriented programming and S3 classes offer a convenient way to iteratively add interoperability in the ecosystem in a way that is minimally disruptive to users and developers. Newly classed input support can be added via custom methods (after converting the existing function to a generic if necessary). Newly classed output support can be added via progressive enhancement, by ensuring that the new class is a subclass of the old one and that downstream code uses good practices to test class inheritance.</p>

<p>There are ongoing outbreaks of mpox globally. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is so far the worst hit with a total of 7,851 cases and 384 deaths reported between January 1 and May 26, 2024 <sup>1</sup>. Before 2022, there were few reports of sustained mpox transmission globally. However, during the following year (Jan 1, 2022, and Jan 29, 2023), 110 countries in all six WHO Regions had reported a total of 85,473 confirmed cases and 89 deaths between them <span class="citation" data-cites="laurenson2023description">(Laurenson-Schafer et al. 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Mpox is transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected persons. The disease is characterized by fever, cough, and a rash, with the mean incubation period estimated to be about 7.8 days <span class="citation" data-cites="ward2022transmission">(Ward et al. 2022)</span>. Infected individuals may experience severe symptoms leading to hospitalisation or death. There are two genetic clades: clade I and clade II, which also has subclades IIa and IIb <span class="citation" data-cites="laurenson2023description">(Laurenson-Schafer et al. 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Several analyses of the potential impact of outbreaks at country level have already emerged in 2024. The US CDC, for example, has analysed the potential size of outbreaks resulting from transmission within and between households <sup>2</sup> and the risk of Clade 1 mpox outbreaks among some key populations associated with key transmission routes <sup>3</sup>. Another group of researchers have estimated the transmissibility of mpox in the DRC from more recent (2010 - 2019) surveillance data to update existing estimates, which are based on old data <span class="citation" data-cites="charniga2024updating">(Charniga, McCollum, et al. 2024)</span>. However, tackling ongoing outbreaks around the world will require a coordinated response from the global health community.</p>
<p>The Epiverse-TRACE team is developing a set of analytical tools that could help support decision-makers during outbreaks. This post provides an overview of the tasks that such tools can be applied to in the context of the ongoing mpox outbreaks.</p>
<section id="common-outbreak-analytics-tasks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-outbreak-analytics-tasks">Common outbreak analytics tasks</h2>
<p>Outbreak analytics in the context of the ongoing mpox outbreak involves several tasks that can be handled by existing and emerging R tools. Some of the tasks include estimating the transmission potential, forecasting infection dynamics, estimating severity, and assessing the impact of interventions.</p>
<p>Here, we briefly describe some common tasks, data required, and the ready R tools/packages developed by the Epiverse-TRACE team and the wider community.</p>

<p>Data cleaning is often the first task in outbreak analytics. This usually involves identifying and correcting errors in the data, standardizing the format of key variables, and ensuring that the data is in a format that is fit for analysis. Data validation is also important to ensure that the data is accurate.</p>

<p>A key initial question during emerging outbreaks is the transmission potential of the disease. This is typically quantified using parameters such as: the basic reproduction number, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0">; the time-varying reproduction number, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t">; and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k">, which captures individual heterogeneity in transmission (i.e.&nbsp;“superspreading” potential). These quantities are useful to assess the potential for further spread of the disease and the impact of interventions.</p>

<p>The basic reproduction number, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0">, is the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population. The time-varying reproduction number, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t">, on the other hand, is the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual at time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> in a partially susceptible population. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t"> is a more useful quantity during an outbreak as it accounts for the impact of interventions and changes in population immunity.</p>

While <code>{EpiEstim}</code> focuses on retrospective estimation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t">, <code>{EpiNow2}</code> is designed for both retrospective and real-time estimation.</p>
<p>In estimating <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t">, one practical consideration is the impact of various delays (biological and reporting) on the estimates <span class="citation" data-cites="charniga2024best park2024estimating gostic2020practical">(Charniga, Park, et al. 2024; Park et al. 2024; Katelyn M. Gostic 2020)</span>. <code>{EpiNow2}</code> adjusts for these delays in various ways. For example, it accounts for the symptom onset and reporting delays by taking the incubation period and reporting delay as inputs. Moreover, <code>{EpiNow2}</code> can estimate the reporting delay from the data if data on incidence by date of onset and report are available.</p>
<p>Furthermore, dedicated packages have emerged for estimating epidemiological delays from data using best practices. <a href="https://epidist.epinowcast.org/articles/epidist.html"><code>{epidist}</code></a> offers the ability to estimate delay distributions, accounting for issues such as truncation (i.e., not all disease outcomes will yet be known in real-time).</p>
<p>If delay data are not available, published estimates of the incubation period and serial interval can be used. The <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/"><code>{epiparameter}</code></a> package collates a database of epidemiological distributions from the literature and provides functions for interacting with the database. You can view the <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/dev/articles/database">database</a> for currently available parameters (more entries are planned). Additionally, if only summary statistics are available (e.g.&nbsp;range and median), <code>{epiparameter}</code> can be used to extract the distribution parameters.</p>

</div>
<p>If we have data on the distribution of sizes of transmission clusters, the <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epichains/"><code>{epichains}</code></a> package provides functions to set up the likelihood function to estimate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k">. The user inputs the negative binomial offspring, which assumes individuals exhibit heterogeneity in transmission. The parameters of the negative offspring distribution can then be estimated using existing maximum likelihood or bayesian frameworks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we have individual-level transmission chain data, the <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/"><code>{superspreading}</code></a> package can be used to estimate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> from the offspring distribution. This package also provides functions to estimate the probability that an outbreak will not go extinct in its early stages because of randomness in transmission (e.g.&nbsp;if the primary spillover case(s) does not infect others).</p>
<p>If we have data on sexual contacts and the secondary attack rate, then we can also use <code>{superspreading}</code> to <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/articles/heterogeneous_network_outbreaks.html">calculate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0"> accounting for network effects</a>.</p>

<p>Forecasting and nowcasting of infections are crucial for planning and resource allocation during an outbreak. Forecasting is the prediction of future cases, deaths, or other outcomes, while nowcasting is the prediction of the current outbreak situation. These predictions can help public health authorities to anticipate the trajectory of the outbreak and to implement timely interventions.</p>

<p><a href="https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/"><code>{EpiNow2}</code></a> and <a href="https://package.epinowcast.org/"><code>{epinowcast}</code></a> provide functions to forecast and nowcast the number of cases. The data required for <code>{EpiNow2}</code> has already been described in the previous section.

<p>In this post, we have outlined common outbreak analytics tasks relevant to the mpox outbreak, the data required, and R packages/tools that are currently available to facilitate these tasks. The tools described here are being developed by the Epiverse-TRACE team and the wider community, with the aim of ensuring high standards of research software development, and validation from end users, including epidemiologists, clinicians, and policy makers. The tools are designed to be user-friendly and well integrated, enabling one analysis task to easily feed into another. We <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/get-involved.html">would therefore be keen to hear</a> from other groups interested in potentially collaborating or contributing on this growing ecosystem of tools.</p>

  <title>Choosing the Right Parent for R Object Classes</title>
  <dc:creator>Hugo Gruson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/parent-class/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://hugogruson.fr/posts/compa-tibble/">I have recently published</a> a <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/s3-generic/">series of blog posts</a> on the reasons why one may want to start using object-oriented programming (and more specifically R S3 classes) to improve interoperability with other tools from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>But there are still questions I have not addressed directly, even if they may have been implicitly included sometimes: what makes a good object class? What good practices in class &amp; function design can improve interoperability?</p>
<p>As you can expect from these questions, this post will present a subjective view on S3 class and method design. I will argue that it is often a good strategy to inherit from existing standards classes, and to leverage this inheritance relationship as much as possible.</p>
<section id="inherit-from-standard-classes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inherit-from-standard-classes">Inherit from standard classes</h2>
<p>A unique feature of R is the availability and centrality of <code>data.frame</code>s in the base language, whereas you need extra libraries for a similar functionality in most other languages (e.g., <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> in Python).</p>
<p><code>data.frame</code> is one of the first “complex” (in the sense of <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#atomic-vectors">non-atomic</a>) object most R learners will be exposed to and will develop a familiarity with. A good way to leverage this familiarity is to <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/extend-dataframes/">make your subclass a thin wrapper around <code>data.frame</code>s</a>.</p>
<p>This means that not only will users be able to get started with your package faster because of this familiarity, but you will also immediately benefit from the huge ecosystem of functions and packages working on <code>data.frame</code>s, such as the <a href="https://tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a>. If you want some examples, this is what collaborators and I did in the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist">linelist</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rmaia/pavo">pavo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils">scoringutils</a>, <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains">epichains</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/vaccineff">vaccineff</a> R packages.</p>
<p>In some cases, the output is too complex to fit into a <code>data.frame</code>. Even in this situation, I would recommend inheriting from existing, well-established, classes for the same two reasons: familiarity and ecosystem. For example, for the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi">serofoi</a> R package, <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi/pull/117">we have made the decision to inherit from <code>stanfit</code> objects, rather than a custom structure</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="rely-on-parent-methods-as-much-as-possible" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rely-on-parent-methods-as-much-as-possible">Rely on parent methods as much as possible</h2>
<p>A follow up recommendation from inheriting from standard classes is to leverage their methods wherever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist/pull/60">One of the first</a> <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist/pull/61">changes I made</a> when becoming maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist">linelist</a> package was to remove the <code>rename.linelist()</code> and <code>select.linelist()</code> methods. Indeed, they were, or could easily be, behaving identically as the parent <code>rename.data.frame()</code> and <code>select.data.frame()</code> methods. Rather than burdening the codebase and maintenance with an extra unnecessary method, it is much simpler and more robust to rely on the well-tested parent method. In fact, the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_extending.html">dplyr documentation</a> explicitly recommends only writing methods for a couple of standard functions (including <code>[.subclass()</code> and <code>names&lt;-.subclass()</code>), which will enable the use of parent methods directly, rather than writing custom methods for each dplyr function.</p>
<p>Similarly, many developers have the reflex to write a custom <code>print.subclass()</code> method as part of the method implementation. While it may be justified in some cases, it is sometimes unnecessary. My recommendation would be to evaluate carefully what benefits the custom method brings over the default parent method.</p>
</section>
<section id="enable-conversion-to-standard-classes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enable-conversion-to-standard-classes">Enable conversion to standard classes</h2>
<p>If after careful consideration, extra metadata makes it too difficult to fit your new class into an existing class, you may sometimes have to define your own class from “scratch” (i.e., often <code>list()</code> in R).</p>
<p>But even in this case, you can still apply some of the ideas proposed earlier. As much as possible, you should provide helpers or methods to enable the streamlined conversion of your method to a standard class.</p>
<p>A good example here is the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter">epiparameter</a> package, which provides a complex S3 class built on lists, including extensive metadata about probability distribution of epidemiological parameters. As such, this custom class cannot be used out of the box in most functions from other packages. <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/0f805b90f984def4851a78148f1cf44c3d480845/R/coercion.R#L18-L41">But an <code>as.function()</code> method is conveniently provided to enable the conversion of this probability distribution parameters into a density distribution</a>, which can then be used in functions which expect a <code>function</code> object.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, I recommend relying on well-established parent classes such as <code>data.frame</code>s or at least providing direct conversion functions to these standard classes, and using parent methods wherever possible rather than writing custom dedicated methods. This should help produce a package:</p>
<ul>
<li>more easily accessible for users because it uses objects that feel familiar</li>
<li>more maintainable because a lot of method writing is offloaded to the parent class</li>
<li>more likely to be interoperable because standard classes are a good way to pass data between functions or packages</li>
</ul>
