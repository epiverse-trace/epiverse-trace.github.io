Our aim is to help change how analytics are used in the global infectious disease response, moving towards integrated, generalisable and scalable community-driven software.

## Roadmap

![ ](task_pipeline-minimal.svg){fig-alt='A typical epidemiological pipeline presented as a flowchart. Each box corresponds to a specific task (e.g., "reconstruct transmission chains", or "estimate severity"). The tasks are split into three categories based on the position in the data pipeline: early tasks, middle tasks and late tasks.'}

## Epiverse-TRACE packages

These are built on methods and analysis that have informed epidemic response to infections including cholera, COVID, dengue, diphtheria, Ebola, influenza, and Zika.
