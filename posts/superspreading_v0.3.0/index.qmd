We are very excited to announce the release of a new [superspreading](<https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading>) version v0.3.0. This is the first version of superspreading to be on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=superspreading) (the package can now be installed with `install.packages()`).
Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.

The third minor release of the _superspreading_ package contains enhancements to several functions and a new vignette. 

We are also pleased to welcome Dillon Adam (@dcadam) as a new package author for his contributions towards this version.

## New features

* The `proportion_transmission()` function has been expanded to incorporate a new method. The new method calculates the proportion of transmission from X% the most infectious individuals, corresponding to the [Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature04153) calculation. The `proportion_transmission()` has a new `method` argument to toggle between the two calculations (@dcadam, #99).
* A new vignette explaining the methods in the `proportion_transmission()` function (#101). 
* {bpmodels} is removed as a package dependency and a branching process simulation function, modified from `bpmodels::chain_sim()`, is added to the {superspreading} package (#103). @sbfnk is added as copyright holder and @jamesmbaazam as a contributor.
* `probability_contain()` is enhanced to enable to probability of containment within a certain amount of time since the outbreak started. This adds `outbreak_time` and `generation_time` arguments to `probability_contain()`. This addition is backwards compatible as by default the time is unlimited, `outbreak_time = Inf`, and no generation time is required.

## Breaking changes

* The `stochastic` argument in `probability_contain()` has been renamed `simulate` to be consistent with other functions (#103).

## Minor changes

* The proportions output of `proportion_*()` functions are now formatted to significant figures rather than rounding to prevent small values being rounded to zero (#102).
* Improve input checking, error messages and edge case handling for functions (#102).
* Vignettes now use `rmarkdown::html_vignette` instead of `bookdown::html_vignette2` and `as_is: true` has been removed due to changes to {pkgdown} in v2.1.0. {bookdown} has been removed as a suggested package and code folding is removed from vignettes. KaTeX headers have been added to `_pkgdown.yml` for correct math rendering (#104 & #109).
* The `get_epidist_params()` internal function has been renamed `get_epiparameter_params()` since {epiparameter} renamed the `<epidist>` class to `<epiparameter>` (#100).
* Internal constants have been added to the package and used by functions (#111). 
* Checking if the user specifies individual parameters (`R` and `k`) or provides an `<epiparameter>` object is now in `.check_input_params()` (#111).

## Bug fixes

* None to {superspreading} functions.
* Update {epiparameter} use in vignette and tests (#106).

## Deprecated and defunct

* None
