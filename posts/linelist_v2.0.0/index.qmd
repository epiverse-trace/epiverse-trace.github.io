We are very excited to announce the release of a new [linelist](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/linelist) version v2.0.0.
Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.

## Breaking changes

* The linelist package is now dependent on R 4.1.0, in line with Epiverse-TRACE
  policy regarding minimum R version dependency
  (#159, [&#x0040;Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo)).

* Deprecated functions and arguments have been completely removed. The following
  operations are no longer possible:

  * List of tags now needs to be spliced in `make_linelist()`:

    ```r
    my_tags <- list(
      id = "case_ID",
      date_onset = "date_of_prodrome",
      age = "age",
      gender = "gender"
    )

    # No longer possible
    make_linelist(obj, my_tags)

    # Instead slice list in dynamic dots
    make_linelist(obj, !!!my_tags)
    ```

  * `select_tags()`:

    ```r
    # No longer possible
    x %>%
      select_tags("age")

    # Instead use
    x %>%
      select(has_tag("age")) %>%
      tags_df()
    ```

  * `select.linelist()`. This change should be invisible to users since the
    parent method `select.data.frame()` will be used with the same effect.

  * `lost_tags_action()` as part of a pipeline is no longer possible:

    ```r
    # No longer possible
    make_linelist(cars, date_onset = "dist", date_outcome = "speed") |>
      lost_tags_action("none") |>
      dplyr::select(-dist)

    # Instead do
    lost_tags_action("none")
    make_linelist(cars, date_onset = "dist", date_outcome = "speed") |>
      dplyr::select(-dist)
    ```
