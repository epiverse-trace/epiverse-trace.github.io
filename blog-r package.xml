  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>GitHub recently previewed <a href="https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/">‘Copilot Workspace’</a>, which aims to use generative AI to assist software developers. Rather than just giving in-line suggestions, as GitHub copilot does, workspace allows users to map out and execute entire projects. We got early preview access to the tool, so decided to see how well it performed for our needs in Epiverse-TRACE.</p>
<p>In the Epiverse-TRACE initiative we aim to develop an ecosystem of epidemic analytics tools as <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods</a> in the form of R packages. We aim to <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/blueprints/">follow best-practices</a> given that our tools will be used to inform public health decisions. For efficiency, we use a range of development tools, including integrated development environments (IDE), such as RStudio and Visual Studio Code, other R packages to help check and document our code, for example {lintr} and {roxygen2}, and version control and code sharing tools, git and GitHub.</p>
<p>Given the rapid development and increasing availability to artificial intelligence (AI) models, specifically large language models, offer the potential to be another development tool to add to the arsenal of researchers and software engineers to enhance productivity and improve the reliability of the code we write and others depend upon <span class="citation" data-cites="vanHoek2024">(Hoek et al. 2024)</span>. Large language models like ChatGPT from OpenAI, Gemini from Google, Claude from Anthropic, as well as many others and new ones frequently appearing, have presented opportunities to quickly generate material – text, code and images – from text prompts.</p>
<p>A small group of Epiverse-TRACE professors and research software engineers decided to explore the suitability of one such, GitHub Copilot integrated with GitHub Workspaces, for some typical use cases encountered in our day-to-day work. We do note that many other such tools are available, and we chose Copilot in Workspaces as our code is hosted on GitHub, making for easy evaluation of the specific contribution of the AI tool. However, some of our broad conclusions are based on using other tools for similar tasks.</p>
<p>The aim of this blog post is to summarise our experiences with Copilot and Workspaces, and share our thoughts more generally about how the current feature set of AI-powered development tools could help with our daily development tasks, and with research software development at large. We evaluated Copilot workspace across three tasks of varying difficulty and requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Experiment 1: Exporting an R function by updating the documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 2: Adding a basic epidemic model to an existing R package that contains other epidemiological models</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 3: Conducting a code review on an R package</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first experiment was on the {EpiNow2} R package. An existing <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2/issues/681">Issue #681</a> was chosen. It was a simple task to evaluate Copilot workspace’s ability to interpret requests that require small changes to the codebase of a package (i.e.&nbsp;can be achieved in a single commit by changing less than 5 lines of code). The issue stated that an internal function, <code>epinow2_cmdstan_model()</code> should be exported, with the issue description explaining this would help users specify custom options for running the models.</p>

<section id="outcome" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
<p>The specification provided by Copilot workspace diagnosed the issue requirements, mentioning that the <code>NAMESPACE</code> file, which stores information on functions offered by a package and functions imported from other packages, would have to be updated for the R package to export this currently unexported function. The proposed solution also addressed the desired changes, stating that the function was to be exported and the keyword <code>internal</code> would be removed. The automatically generated plan proposed to edit the file documentation and <code>NAMESPACE</code>, but we edited this to more specifically replace the <code>@keyword internal</code> {roxygen} tag with <code>@export</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-thoughts">Our thoughts</h3>
<p>The implementation offered by GitHub copilot workspace was correct and replaced <code>@keywords internal</code> with <code>@export</code> in the correct function documentation <code>epinow2_stan_model()</code>.</p>
<p>However, it also changed the formatting of one of the function arguments (<code>@param model</code>) by moving some text to the next line and added a comma to the last but one item listed in the sentence. (It seems AI has taken a side on the Oxford comma debate).</p>
<p>Overall, this test case of GitHub copilot workspace was a partial success. It correctly recognised the links between inline R function documentation, Roxygen tags, and the R-specific documentation files in <code>man/</code>. However, it (naturally) does not have a mechanistic understanding of package development and how changing tags in documentation is used to auto-update doc files using development tools. It correctly modified the part of the file needed to export an internal function. This showcases an example of where this technology can be beneficial: those new to a language or paradigm that have not yet picked up all of the development details that are often second nature to experienced developers. In this example, the time taken to make this change in GitHub copilot workspace was likely ~10x longer than what our RSEs would take. However, if someone was used to developing in say, Python, and was new to the conventions of exporting functions in R using {roxygen} documentation, this test case shows how copilot workspace can reliably assist. On the other hand, because these changes make no reference to standard development tools, they would not help new developers learn how or where to use them.</p>
<p>The changes made will still require the user to manually run the documentation (using either <code>devtools::document()</code> or <code>roxygen2::roxygenize()</code>) to update the package <code>NAMESPACE</code> for the function to be exported. Our recommendation would be for AI tools to integrate with and call development tools used by developers (analogous to pre-commit hooks running tools before committing) to make sure this is taken care of all in a single generative step.</p>

<p>{epidemics} is an Epiverse-TRACE R package that exports a range of compartmental epidemiological models of varying complexities and applications.</p>
<p>In the second test case, we created an issue in the {epidemics} R package requesting a basic SIR model, with the issue description requesting the model to have no age structure and to use existing functionality in the package to specify a disease intervention. Additionally, the issue requested that the model be solved with the {deSolve} R package, which is a differential equation solver in R. A basic SIR model would have been new to the package, but one of several other compartmental models, and simpler than the models already implemented.</p>

<section id="outcome-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outcome-1">Outcome</h3>
<p>GitHub copilot workspace outlined the existing functionality in the package and proposed changes including adding a new file called <code>R/model_sir.R</code>, which follows the <code>model_*.R</code> naming convention used in {epidemics}. As requested, copilot also proposed that the new SIR model would support the use of interventions that are already been implemented in the package.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-thoughts-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-thoughts-1">Our thoughts</h3>
<p>The code generated was an R function that constructed a basic SIR model, and this was well documented using a {roxygen2} documentation block. However, several aspects of the code generated did not match the proposal generated by copilot workspace, and the code contained inadvisable coding practices in R (i.e.&nbsp;code smells). Firstly the SIR model itself. The model implemented follows the standard set of differential equations that are solved using {deSolve}, as requested in our prompt. However, the model does not have any options to input interventions, which the proposed solution by GitHub copilot workspace suggested it would. The second downside is the use of <code>require(deSolve)</code> in the function body of the generated code. This is bad practice in R package development as functions should namespace any functions that are being called from other packages (e.g.&nbsp;<code>packagename::func_name()</code>).</p>
<p>This task required copilot workspace to understand the contents and conventions of the {epidemics} R package and generate a simple compartmental model which would integrate with the infrastructure in the package for defining interventions in models. Although it correctly summarised the package contents, its attempt to answer the specific request from our prompt had many inaccuracies. The generated code is likely influenced by the many examples of SIR models written in R on the internet and on GitHub. These might be R scripts or gists and thus coding practises used there are not always appropriate for writing code to be distributed in an R package, resulting in decisions like having <code>require(deSolve)</code> in the function.</p>
<p>AI-generated code like that seen in this example showcases where users need to be diligent and not assume that the text descriptions from copilot match the code. In the end, this was a test example and was unlikely to be merged into {epidemics} even if the code was correct. However, with the code generated, it presents almost no use; it would require as much time for an RSE to refactor this function as it would to write one from scratch following the design principles and demands of the {epidemics} package.</p>

</div>
<p>In the last test case, we requested GitHub copilot workspace to conduct a <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist/pull/117">code review of the entire code base of a package</a>. At Epiverse-TRACE, it is standard practise to conduct a full package review. As any code base develops, including R packages, more commits are added and often the number of lines of code increases. Reviewing all of these changes before releasing a new version of the package is a timely undertaking for package reviewers. If AI tools could review the code base, similar to how static code analysers work, and suggest improvements to, for example, code style, memory efficiency, documentation, unit testing, UX/UI, it would greatly improve efficiency before releasing the code.</p>
<section id="outcome-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outcome-2">Outcome</h3>
<p>Here, Copilot provided no analysis of the code base. It regurgitated the changes described in the <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/blueprints/code-review.html#full-package-review">package review pull request</a>, likely from a mix of the pull request description and the changelog (<code>NEWS.md</code> file), and did not analyse any of the code. Therefore, it provided no additional use than if the reviewer had just read the <code>NEWS</code>.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on our trials we observe that GitHub copilot Workspace may not provide a significant benefit to research software engineers in domain-specific R package development, where problems are complex and bespoke solutions are common. The evidence above suggests there’s still a long way to go before AI-powered tools can produce unsupervised code projects equivalent to that of a research software engineer. One observation is that generative AI is better trained for some purposes than others, biased by the amount of training data/information available. This makes it struggle in niche areas with a relatively smaller public code base to train models with (e.g.&nbsp;R functions for epidemic analysis are much rarer than generic JavaScript functions for web design). A second is that AI models don’t seem to understand how different parts of a codebase link together, so they provide solutions that are inconsistent with the requirements of the codebase (design principles, code style, etc). These models may, however, be more useful for more common tasks, such as building dashboard templates.</p>
<p>The test cases we experimented with suggest that this tool will not replace, and at times not even enhance development when the task requires a more integrated development than generating a standalone script. These tools are evolving rapidly and we are sure improvements will continue. In the short term tools like GitHub copilot workspace need to be used responsibly with an awareness of their limitations and not a blind trust that the code it writes is always correct. We would caution against relying on generative AI tools alone to develop software with potentially large-scale impacts - scrutiny by trained developers is still key. Research software engineers will play a key part in this as they will ensure that code and software written with and by AI tools meet required standards, are trustworthy, and are not potentially harmful. Where we see generative AI tools being more immediately useful in research software development is in <a href="https://billyquilty.substack.com/p/llmlinelist-enabling-rapid-outbreak">tasks that require sifting through or summarising vast amounts of information</a>; for example, in querying software documentation, or to help get started with a new programming framework or language.</p>

  <title>Choosing the Right Parent for R Object Classes</title>
  <dc:creator>Hugo Gruson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/parent-class/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://hugogruson.fr/posts/compa-tibble/">I have recently published</a> a <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/s3-generic/">series of blog posts</a> on the reasons why one may want to start using object-oriented programming (and more specifically R S3 classes) to improve interoperability with other tools from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>But there are still questions I have not addressed directly, even if they may have been implicitly included sometimes: what makes a good object class? What good practices in class &amp; function design can improve interoperability?</p>
<p>As you can expect from these questions, this post will present a subjective view on S3 class and method design. I will argue that it is often a good strategy to inherit from existing standards classes, and to leverage this inheritance relationship as much as possible.</p>
<section id="inherit-from-standard-classes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inherit-from-standard-classes">Inherit from standard classes</h2>
<p>A unique feature of R is the availability and centrality of <code>data.frame</code>s in the base language, whereas you need extra libraries for a similar functionality in most other languages (e.g., <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> in Python).</p>
<p><code>data.frame</code> is one of the first “complex” (in the sense of <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#atomic-vectors">non-atomic</a>) object most R learners will be exposed to and will develop a familiarity with. A good way to leverage this familiarity is to <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/extend-dataframes/">make your subclass a thin wrapper around <code>data.frame</code>s</a>.</p>
<p>This means that not only will users be able to get started with your package faster because of this familiarity, but you will also immediately benefit from the huge ecosystem of functions and packages working on <code>data.frame</code>s, such as the <a href="https://tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a>. If you want some examples, this is what collaborators and I did in the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist">linelist</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rmaia/pavo">pavo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils">scoringutils</a>, <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains">epichains</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/vaccineff">vaccineff</a> R packages.</p>
<p>In some cases, the output is too complex to fit into a <code>data.frame</code>. Even in this situation, I would recommend inheriting from existing, well-established, classes for the same two reasons: familiarity and ecosystem. For example, for the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi">serofoi</a> R package, <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/serofoi/pull/117">we have made the decision to inherit from <code>stanfit</code> objects, rather than a custom structure</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="rely-on-parent-methods-as-much-as-possible" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rely-on-parent-methods-as-much-as-possible">Rely on parent methods as much as possible</h2>
<p>A follow up recommendation from inheriting from standard classes is to leverage their methods wherever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist/pull/60">One of the first</a> <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist/pull/61">changes I made</a> when becoming maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist">linelist</a> package was to remove the <code>rename.linelist()</code> and <code>select.linelist()</code> methods. Indeed, they were, or could easily be, behaving identically as the parent <code>rename.data.frame()</code> and <code>select.data.frame()</code> methods. Rather than burdening the codebase and maintenance with an extra unnecessary method, it is much simpler and more robust to rely on the well-tested parent method. In fact, the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_extending.html">dplyr documentation</a> explicitly recommends only writing methods for a couple of standard functions (including <code>[.subclass()</code> and <code>names&lt;-.subclass()</code>), which will enable the use of parent methods directly, rather than writing custom methods for each dplyr function.</p>
<p>Similarly, many developers have the reflex to write a custom <code>print.subclass()</code> method as part of the method implementation. While it may be justified in some cases, it is sometimes unnecessary. My recommendation would be to evaluate carefully what benefits the custom method brings over the default parent method.</p>
</section>
<section id="enable-conversion-to-standard-classes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enable-conversion-to-standard-classes">Enable conversion to standard classes</h2>
<p>If after careful consideration, extra metadata makes it too difficult to fit your new class into an existing class, you may sometimes have to define your own class from “scratch” (i.e., often <code>list()</code> in R).</p>
<p>But even in this case, you can still apply some of the ideas proposed earlier. As much as possible, you should provide helpers or methods to enable the streamlined conversion of your method to a standard class.</p>
<p>A good example here is the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter">epiparameter</a> package, which provides a complex S3 class built on lists, including extensive metadata about probability distribution of epidemiological parameters. As such, this custom class cannot be used out of the box in most functions from other packages. <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/blob/0f805b90f984def4851a78148f1cf44c3d480845/R/coercion.R#L18-L41">But an <code>as.function()</code> method is conveniently provided to enable the conversion of this probability distribution parameters into a density distribution</a>, which can then be used in functions which expect a <code>function</code> object.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, I recommend relying on well-established parent classes such as <code>data.frame</code>s or at least providing direct conversion functions to these standard classes, and using parent methods wherever possible rather than writing custom dedicated methods. This should help produce a package:</p>
<ul>
<li>more easily accessible for users because it uses objects that feel familiar</li>
<li>more maintainable because a lot of method writing is offloaded to the parent class</li>
<li>more likely to be interoperable because standard classes are a good way to pass data between functions or packages</li>
</ul>

<p>R package developers often have to take on dependencies for various reasons. Dependencies are external packages that provide extra functionalities or features to another package <span class="citation" data-cites="wickham2023r">(Wickham and Bryan 2023)</span>. Quite often, the goal of taking on a dependency is to utilize its rich features and reduce duplicated coding effort. For example, the <code>ggplot2</code> package is often adopted, instead of R’s inbuilt plotting functions, to make visualizations using its declarative system and implementation of the Grammar of Graphics, and slick automation across the board.</p>
<p>Sometimes, introducing a dependency might slow down existing processes. Hence, it is important to consider the speed of a dependency’s functions before adopting it. Code optimisation is often reserved for heavy processes like data processing steps. However, here, we will focus on lesser optimised processes, and in particular, printing of texts in R.</p>
<p>For this demonstration, we will look at a situation where a package developer is considering options for condition signalling beyond the functionalities provided in base R. Condition signalling refers to the process of communicating to a user that an issue has arisen during code execution <span class="citation" data-cites="wickham2019advanced">(Wickham 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Base R ships with functionalities for condition signalling. There is <code>base::stop()</code> for signalling errors. Errors refer to cases where something fatal happens during code execution so that it halts, for example, when a function is run without specifying the required arguments.</p>

<div class="cell-output cell-output-error">
<pre><code>Error in rnorm(): argument "n" is missing, with no default</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Base R provides <code>base::warning()</code> for throwing warnings. Warnings are used to handle less fatal issues with code execution that do not need to halt the process. For example, when you compare two vectors of different lengths, R will throw a warning but will still return a result.</p>

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lastly, there is <code>base::message()</code> for throwing messages. Messages are used to provide useful information about processes. For example, packages throw messages about NAMESPACE conflicts when loaded. This is to inform the user so they know what next steps to take.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

</div>
<p>These base R functions are, however, not flexible enough for advanced formatting: colour, progress bar, contextual pluralisation, and so forth. The package developer might want to adopt external dependencies for these flexibilities. The <a href="https://cli.r-lib.org/articles/semantic-cli.html">cli</a> package is well designed for this. <code>cli</code> offers many of the advanced formatting features. Here is a quick example (adopted from the help file) using <code>cli::cli_abort()</code>, the equivalent of <code>base::stop()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Error:

</div>
</div>
<p>In this example, we used inline text formatting to print <code>n</code> as a variable and interpolated code to print the class of <code>n</code> in the error message and all in just 6 lines of code.</p>
<p>If this is enough to excite your interests, check out <code>cli</code>’s <a href="https://cli.r-lib.org/">website</a> and help files, which provide in-depth guides on its myriad features.</p>
<p>Now, considering all these amazing features that <code>cli</code> offers, what should a package developer consider to adopt it? In this article, we will demonstrate how to use (micro)benchmarking<sup>1</sup> to guide the decision through the lense of speed. Benchmarking can be used to check whether adopting <code>cli</code> as a dependency would slow down existing printing processes in undesirable ways.</p>
<p>Here, we will benchmark <code>cli::cli_warn()</code> against base R’s <code>base::warning()</code> to see if the former has any speed issues. The results of this exercise will provide us with insights on whether its worth taking on <code>cli</code> for its features as a trade-off for slower printing speed.</p>
<section id="experiment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experiment">Experiment</h2>
<p>We will consider different scenarios of number of warnings thrown to tease out the relationship between speed of the function and number of warnings thrown in a function with and without <code>cli::cli_warn()</code>. We will also check how the benchmark scales with the number of warnings in the function.</p>
<p>Based on this description, we will need the following packages: <code>cli</code> for its warning function, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bench/index.html">bench</a> for measuring the run times, <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a> for manipulating the results, and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> for plotting.</p>

<p>As we can see, <code>cli</code> is consistently slower than base R for the same number of warnings thrown. The median times also follow a similar non-linear trajectory. Benchmarking experiments with other <code>cli</code> functions have revealed similar non-linear relationships between its speed and the number of times it invokes those functions <sup>2</sup>. However, those exercises were not compared with equivalent functions in base R. The relative comparison here is useful for decision-making.</p>
<p>The developers of <code>cli</code> have also conducted benchmarks of the <code>ansi_*()</code> family of functions in <code>cli</code> in comparison to base R and the <code>fansi</code> package. They find that <code>cli</code> is consistently slower than base R, which corroborates the results of our experiment here. These benchmarks are available in the <code>cli</code> documentation <sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>So, should we be worried about the speed of <code>cli</code>? Well, it depends on the context. The “R Packages” book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan suggests approaching such a decision from a holistic, balanced, and quantitative approach<span class="citation" data-cites="wickham2023r">(Wickham and Bryan 2023)</span>. We’ll leave the reader to make their own decision based on their use case.</p>
<p>Most developers might argue that this is an optimisation overkill<sup>4</sup>. However, it is important to consider speed differences in context. In the case of simple printing, the speed difference is negligible yet disruptive and somewhat painful. However, in the grand scheme of things, this might be nothing compared with much slower processes that need more attention. In those cases, the developer might want to consider other optimisation strategies such as profiling <sup>5</sup>. The essence of this experiment is to demonstrate the utility of benchmarking in making quick design decisions.</p>

Here, we have demonstrated how benchmarking is one way to achieve this for a process involving condition signalling. We show how a simple decision to use <code>cli::cli_warn()</code> to handle warnings could come at the cost of a tiny loss in speed, which is worth considering in its context.</p>
<p>The demonstration here can be extended to other dependency adoption decisions for input checking, loops, object manipulations, and so forth. We recommend benchmarking as a way to help developers make quick design decisions. However, we also recommend that developers consider the context of the optimisation in interpreting the results.</p>

  <title>System Dependencies in R Packages &amp; Automatic Testing</title>
  <dc:creator>Hugo Gruson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/system-dependencies/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>This post has been <a href="https://blog.r-hub.io/2023/09/26/system-dependency/">cross-posted on the R-hub blog</a>, and the R-hub blog maintainers have contributed to the review and improvement of this post.</em></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.r-hub.io/2022/09/12/r-dependency/">previous R-hub blog post</a>, we discussed a package dependency that goes slightly beyond the normal R package ecosystem dependency: R itself. Today, we step even further and discuss dependencies outside of R: system dependencies. This happens when packages rely on external software, such as how <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+cuda+path%3ADESCRIPTION&amp;type=code">R packages integrating CUDA GPU computation in R</a> require the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA library</a>. In particular, we are going to talk about system dependencies in the context of automated testing: is there anything extra to do when setting continuous integration for your package with system dependencies? In particular, we will focus with the integration with <a href="https://beamilz.com/posts/series-gha/2022-series-gha-1-what-is/en/">GitHub Actions</a>. How does it work behind the scenes? And how to work with edge cases?</p>
<section id="introduction-specifying-system-dependencies-in-r-packages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-specifying-system-dependencies-in-r-packages">Introduction: specifying system dependencies in R packages</h2>
<p>Before jumping right into the topic of continuous integration, let’s take a moment to introduce, or remind you, how system dependencies are specified in R packages.</p>
<p>The official ‘Writing R Extensions’ guide states <sup>1</sup>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dependencies external to the R system should be listed in the ‘SystemRequirements’ field, possibly amplified in a separate README file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was initially purely designed for humans. No system within R itself makes use of it. One important thing to note is that this field contains free text :scream:. As such, to refer to the same piece of software, you could write either one of the following in the package <code>DESCRIPTION</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">SystemRequirements</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"> ExternalSoftware</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">SystemRequirements</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"> ExternalSoftware 0.1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">SystemRequirements</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"> lib-externalsoftware</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, it is probably good practice check what other R packages with similar system dependencies are writing in <code>SystemRequirements</code>, to facilitate the automated identification process we describe below.</p>

<section id="the-general-case-everything-works-automagically" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-general-case-everything-works-automagically">The general case: everything works automagically</h2>
<p>If while reading the previous section, you could already sense the problems linked to the fact <code>SystemRequirements</code> is a free-text field, fret not! In the very large majority of cases, setting up continuous integration in an R package with system dependencies is exactly the same as with any other R package.</p>
<p>Using, as often, the supercharged usethis package, you can automatically create the relevant GitHub Actions workflow file in your project <sup>2</sup>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1">usethis<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">use_github_action</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"check-standard"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The result is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<p>You may notice there is no explicit mention of system dependencies in this file. Yet, if we use this workflow in an R package with system dependencies, everything will work out-of-the-box in most cases. So, when are system dependencies installed? And how the workflow does even know which dependencies to install since the <code>SystemRequirements</code> is free text that may not correspond to the exact name of a library?</p>
<p>The magic happens in the <code>r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies</code> step. If you want to learn about it, you can read the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/756399d909bf9c180bbdafe8025f794f51f2da02/setup-r-dependencies/action.yaml">source code of this step</a>. It is mostly written in R but it contains a lot of bells and whistles to handle messaging within the GitHub Actions context and as such, it would be too long to go through it line by line in this post. However, at a glance, you can notice many mentions of the <a href="https://pak.r-lib.org/">pak R package</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s the first time you’re hearing about the pak package, we strongly recommend we go through the <a href="https://pak.r-lib.org/reference/features.html">list of the most important pak features</a>. It is <del>paked</del> packed with many very powerful features. The specific feature we’re interested in here is the automatic install of system dependencies via <a href="https://pak.r-lib.org/reference/local_system_requirements.html"><code>pak::pkg_sysreqs()</code></a>, which in turn uses <code>pkgdepends::sysreqs_install_plan()</code>.</p>
<p>We now understand more precisely where the magic happens but it still doesn’t explain how pak is able to know which precise piece of software to install from the free text <code>SystemRequirements</code> field. As often when you want to increase your understanding, it is helpful to <a href="https://blog.r-hub.io/2019/05/14/read-the-source/">read the source</a>. While browsing pkgdepends source code, we see a call to <a href="https://github.com/r-hub/r-system-requirements" class="uri">https://github.com/r-hub/r-system-requirements</a>.</p>
<p>This repository contains a set of <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements/tree/main/rules">rules</a> as json files which match unformatted software name via regular expressions to the exact libraries for each major operating system. Let’s walk through an example together:</p>

<p>The regular expression tells that each time a package lists something as <code>SystemRequirements</code> with the word “nvcc” or “cuda”, the corresponding Ubuntu library to install is <code>nvidia-cuda-dev</code>.</p>
<p>This interaction between <code>r-system-requirements</code> and pak is also documented in pak’s dev version, with extra information about how the <code>SystemRequirements</code> field is extracted in different situations: <a href="https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/sysreqs.html#how-it-works" class="uri">https://pak.r-lib.org/dev/reference/sysreqs.html#how-it-works</a></p>

<p>We are now realizing that this automagical setup we didn’t pay so much attention to until now actually requires a very heavy machinery under the hood. And it happens, very rarely, that this complex machinery is not able to handle your specific use case. But it doesn’t mean that you cannot use continuous integration in your package. It means that some extra steps might be required to do so. Let’s review these possible solutions together in order of complexity.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fix-it-for-everybody-by-submitting-a-pull-request">Fix it for everybody by submitting a pull request</h3>
<p>One first option might be that the regular expression used by <code>r-system-requirements</code> to convert the free text in <code>SystemRequirements</code> to a library distributed by your operating system does not recognize what is in <code>SystemRequirements</code>.</p>
<p>To identify if this is the case, you need to find the file containing the specific rule for the system dependency of interest in <code>r-system-requirements</code>, and test the regular expression on the contents of <code>SystemRequirements</code>.</p>
<p>If we re-use the cuda example from the previous section and we are wondering why it is not automatically installed for a package specifying “cudaa”:</p>

<p>This test confirms that the <code>SystemRequirements</code> field contents are not recognized by the regular expression. Depending on the case, the best course of action might be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>either edit the contents of <code>SystemRequirements</code> so that it’s picked up by the regular expression</li>
<li>or submit a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements"><code>rstudio/r-system-requirements</code></a> <sup>3</sup> if you believe the regular expression is too restrictive and should be updated (<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements/pull/93">example</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note however that the first option is likely always the simplest as it doesn’t impact all the rest of the ecosystem (which is why <code>r-system-requirements</code> maintainers might be reluctant to relax a regular expression) and it is often something directly in your control, rather than a third-party who might not immediately be available to review your PR.</p>

<p>However, you might be in a case where you cannot rely on the automated approach. For example, maybe the system dependency to install is not provided by package managers at all. Typically, if you had to compile or install it manually on your local computer, you’re very likely to have to do the same operation in GitHub Actions. There two different, but somewhat equivalent, ways to do so, as detailed below.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we have provided an overview of how to specify system requirements for R package, how this seemingly innocent task requires a very complex infrastructure so that it can be understood by automated tools and that your dependencies are smoothly installed in a single command. We also gave some pointers on what to do if you’re in one of the rare cases where the automated tools don’t or can’t work.</p>
<p>One final note on this topic is that there might be a move from CRAN to start requiring more standardization in the <code>SystemRequirements</code> field. One R package developer has reported being asked to change “Java JRE 8 or higher” to “Java (&gt;= 8)”.</p>

  <title>Communicating development stages of open-source software</title>
  <dc:creator>Joshua W. Lambert</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Software is not immediately stable when being developed. It undergoes design changes, changes to the user interface (application programming interface, API), and features get added or removed over time. Software in a open-source setting, in which the code is publicly hosted in a repository (e.g., Github, GitLab, Bitbucket), allows anyone to track developments. It also allows the developer community to easily contribute to the software.</p>
<p>There are certain metrics which can be used to convey the stage of development to users or other developers. For example the number of commits, a repository with few commits may indicate that a project is still in an incipient phase and will undergo several breaking changes. However, different software projects become stable at different rates and the number of commits may mean very different things for a repository containing an operating system compared to an R package with minimal functionality. It is therefore important that developers communicate with users and other developers at what stage the project is in, and how stable the code base is.</p>
<p>Software development, and specifically R package development, has several methods to communicate stability. This blog post will discuss two such methods and give examples for each. The first of these is versioning code, which establishes points in development where the code is ready for use; and the second is lifecycle badges, these can be placed at a different levels within software (e.g., package, function, function argument) to convey how a user should interact and use.</p>
<section id="versioning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="versioning">Versioning</h2>
<p>Versioning code is not a new concept and has been used for decades<sup>1</sup>. It has led to version control systems such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>. However, in this post we are interested in versioning to communicate development.</p>
<section id="semantic-versioning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="semantic-versioning">Semantic versioning</h3>
<p>One such philosophy is <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> (SemVer). This aims to describe the stage of software development by attaching semantics (i.e.&nbsp;meaning) to the format and numbering of versions. The version system works through three numbers, each separated by a dot. The numbers, from left to right, convey major version, minor version and patch version. As an example, 0.5.2, is newer than 0.3.9.</p>
<p>Employing semantic versioning in ones code development allows others to determine whether a package has undergone substantial development and testing, and informs to whether it would make a suitable package to use in a script or as a dependency for another package. Semantic versioning also describes the changes made to a package. As explained on <a href="https://semver.org/">their website</a>, incrementing the major version implies a breaking change, a minor increment is a backwards compatible change and lastly patches are mostly applied to bug fixes. This aids users in understanding whether they should continue using a package, whether their package needs updating due to a breaking change or whether they need to install the newest version because a bug was recently fixed.</p>
<p>Examples of changes that correspond to major, minor or patch updates can be seen in the version release notes (NEWS.md file) of <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/NEWS.md">{dplyr}</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/NEWS.md">{ggplot2}</a>.</p>
<p>In R there are several packages that work with versioning, and specifically semantic versioning. The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=semver">{semver}</a> package provides functions for parsing, rendering and comparing versions. There is also the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=semverutils">{semverutils}</a> R package which provides similar functionality using <code>R6</code>. The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=usethis">{usethis}</a> package provides handy utility functions for changing the versions of R packages (<code>usethis::use_version()</code> and <code>usethis::use_dev_version()</code>). R also comes with a <code>package_version()</code> function for creating and validating versions.</p>
<p>Overall semantic versioning provides what they describe as a “formal specification” to facilitate management of package development and the dependencies of that package. It is the most widely-used versioning system and therefore will be understood by a wide variety of users and developers.</p>
<p>Some of the critique raised for semantic versioning is the difficulty of defining how changes correspond to a version increment. Semantic versioning states only breaking changes warrant major releases, but a vast re-write of a code base may also justify a major version change. Different breaking changes have different magnitudes, therefore a change to a single exported function or a change to every exported function will be communicated in a single, equal, version increment.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternatives-to-semantic-versioning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alternatives-to-semantic-versioning">Alternatives to semantic versioning</h3>
<p>There are several other versioning frameworks aside from semantic versioning. One common option is <a href="https://calver.org/">calendar versioning</a> (CalVer). The format of CalVer is usually year-month (YY-MM), or year-month-day (YY-MM-DD), depending on the regularity of releases, and allows appending tags (micros or modifiers, e.g.&nbsp;YY-MM.1).</p>
<p>Other versioning schemes can appear similar to semantic versioning, but do not follow the guidelines around version semantics. In these cases, a bump in the major version may not relate to a breaking change. Additionally, other numbers can be attached to the traditional x.y.z format, such as build numbers. Build number versioning adds an extra number to specify the build (x.y.z.build_number). There are many other variants but covering all versioning systems is outside the scope of this post.</p>

<section id="versioning-an-r-package" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="versioning-an-r-package">Versioning an R package</h3>
<p>There are some restrictions on valid version numbers for R packages. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file">official “Writing R Extensions” guide</a> state:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is a sequence of at least two (and usually three) non-negative integers separated by single ‘.’ or ‘-’ characters.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="why-version" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-version">Why version?</h3>
<p>The benefits of versioning apply beyond communicating with users and developers. Implementing versioning eases reproducibility by allowing systems to record which version of a language or package was used. In R this can be achieved in several ways, with some popular examples being the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html">{renv} package</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a>.</p>

<section id="lifecycle-badges" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lifecycle-badges">Lifecycle badges</h2>
<p>Badges can be pasted onto visible parts of the code, for example a readme document in the root of the repository, to show the development phase and stability. The three badging systems we will discuss in this post are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.repostatus.org/">RepoStatus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/">Tidyverse lifecycles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html">Reconverse lifecyles</a></li>
</ul>
<section id="repostatus" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repostatus">RepoStatus</h3>
<p>RepoStatus is a language agnostic set of badges which describe the stages of code development and the possible transitions between those stages.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, there are multiple stages to communicate both unstable and stable software. There are also multiple paths between each stage, recognising the varied routes software development can take.</p>

<section id="tidyverse" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidyverse">Tidyverse</h3>
<p>The tidyverse approach is broadly similar to RepoStatus. The {lifecycle} R package contains the description of their process. There are four stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Experimental</li>
<li>Stable</li>
<li>Superseded (previously called retired)</li>
<li>Deprecated</li>
</ol>
<p>Most code will go through the experimental phase, as it will likely change its API and the number and order of arguments might change. Once code is not going to drastically change (i.e.&nbsp;no breaking changes), at least from a users point of view, it can be labelled stable. In the tidyverse lifecycle schematic, all experimental code transitions to stable code.</p>
<p>The two stages that follow stable are: superseded and deprecated. The former describes a situation in which a new package, a new function or a new argument, depending on the context, has been developed which the developer feels should be used instead of the now superseded code. Superseded code is still developed in the sense that changes to the language or package that may break the function will be fixed as well as bug fixes, but the function will not received ongoing development. The latter, deprecation, is used in cases when the developer thinks that a package or function should not longer be used. This is primarily employed when code is depended on by other software and therefore deleting the code would cause breaks in reverse dependencies. Thus the deprecation warning allows developers of those dependencies time to make the relevant changes.</p>

<figcaption>{lifecycle} badge system. <em>Reused under MIT license from <a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html">lifecycles R package</a></em></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>One of the main differences between the tidyverse lifecycles, compared to the others discussed in this posts is their applicability at different levels in the code. The lifecycle badges can be applied at the package-level (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr">stringr</a>), the function-level (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/16b472fb2afc50a87502c2b4ed803e2f5f82b9d6/R/group-trim.R"><code>dplyr::group_trim()</code></a>) or the argument level (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/16b472fb2afc50a87502c2b4ed803e2f5f82b9d6/R/across.R#L36"><code>dplyr::across()</code></a>).</p>
<p>Using {lifecycle} in a package can be setup using <code>usethis::use_lifecycle()</code>. The {lifecycle} package not only provides badges, but also informative deprecation notices which communicate to users that a function is not longer supported since a version release of a package. This offers the user a chance to find an alternative function for future use.</p>
<p>The use of deprecation warnings from {lifecycle} leads onto another aspect of tidyverse development: protracted deprecation. There is no fixed rules on how long after a deprecation warning is made to when code should be removed. In the tidyverse, this process is given ample time in order to allow the many developers that utilise tidyverse software to make the necessary changes. Full descriptions of the {lifecycle} package can be found on the <a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/index.html">website</a>, including the deprecated use of questioning and maturing stages.</p>
</section>
<section id="reconverse" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reconverse">Reconverse</h3>
<p>Reconverse provides four stages of software development:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>concept</li>
<li>experimental</li>
<li>maturing</li>
<li>stable</li>
</ol>
<p>A difference between {lifecycle} and reconverse is the explicit connection between semantic versioning and development stage in <a href="https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html">reconverse</a>. The transitions between experimental, maturing and stable are linked to the versioning less than 0.1.0, less than 1.0.0 and greater than 1.0.0, respectively.</p>
</section>
<section id="dynamic-badges" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dynamic-badges">Dynamic badges</h3>
<p>All badge frameworks discussed only offer static badges that require developers to manually update as the project moves between phases. This is subject to the maintainers remembering, which can lead to miscommunication about a package’s stage, which may have move on from being experimental, or not been worked on in years but has an active badge.</p>
<p>Dynamics badges, like those offered by <a href="https://shields.io/" class="uri">https://shields.io/</a> give a good indication of how recently the project was changed by showing time since last commit, or the number of commits since last release. These too are not perfect but may better track changes and take the burden of badge updates off the project maintainer.</p>

<section id="communicating-development-in-the-epiverse-trace" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communicating-development-in-the-epiverse-trace">Communicating development in the Epiverse-TRACE</h2>
<p>Within the Epiverse-TRACE initiative we use semantic versioning and badges to convey to the community interacting with our code at which stage of developement each project is in. We do not have fixed rules on which badges to use and a variety of badges can be found across the repositories in the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace">organisation</a>. For example reconverse badges are used for <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist">{linelist}</a>, RepoStatus badge is used in <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/finalsize">{finalsize}</a>, and tidyverse badges are used in <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter">{epiparameter}</a>.</p>
<p>We take this approach as no lifecycle badging system is perfect, each with benefits and downsides. The badges from {lifecycle} are the most common and thus recognisable in R package development, however may not port well to other languages or be familiar to developers coming to R from other frameworks. RepoStatus has the benefit of not being designed for a single language, and it’s number of badges gives greater acuity to the stage of development for a project. This may be especially useful if a package is newly developed and {lifecycle} would describe it as experimental, but RepoStatus provides granularity as to whether it is a concept package, work in progress (WIP) or started but abandoned.</p>
<p>There is some ambiguity in the semantics of the active stage in RepoStatus, which in the definition is “stable, usable state”, but may be misinterpreted as being unstable but actively developed.</p>
<p>Lastly reconverse provides a system akin to {lifecycle} and may be useful for those working in the epidemiology developer space. However, one downside of the reconverse system is there are no clear semantics for a package being deprecated or archived. As with almost all code, at some point development ceases and this stage should be communicated, even if just to say that the package is not being updated inline with developments in the underlying language, in this case R.</p>
<p>There are no plans within Epiverse-TRACE to develop a new badging system as the existing systems cover almost all use cases. In the event that the current development stage cannot be adequately communicated with a single badge from one of the frameworks discussed, a combination of badges can be used. For example, early on in a project adding both the experimental badge from {lifecycle} or reconverse and the WIP badge from RepoStatus may more accurately describe the projects develop pace. Alternatively, the stable badge, from either {lifecycle} or reconverse, can be coupled with either active or inactive from RepoStatus to let other developers know if software will be updated with new language features or dependency deprecations.</p>
<p>Overall, the use of any of the three lifecycle frameworks described here is better than none.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-share-c-code-from-an-rcpp-package">Why share C++ code from an Rcpp package</h2>
<p>Using the <a href="https://www.rcpp.org/">{Rcpp}</a> package is the dominant method for linking the usability of R with the speed of C++, and can be used to write R packages that are fast and easy to use for both end-users and developers.</p>
<p>From the point of view of developers, it’s very easy to export R code such as functions and classes from an R(cpp) package, but the guidance in the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Rcpp/versions/1.0.10">Rcpp documentation</a> does not detail how to export the C++ code so that it can be shared with your other Rcpp packages.</p>
<p>Allowing C++ code to be shared can be very beneficial for the same reasons that sharing R code is — packaging code is a reliable way to reuse it.</p>
<p>Some widely used examples of this practice are the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppEigen/index.html">{RcppEigen}</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppArmadillo/index.html">{RcppArmadillo}</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppGSL/index.html">{RcppGSL}</a>, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BH/index.html">Boost Headers {BH}</a> packages. Indeed, in the Epiverse-TRACE team, {RcppEigen} underpins the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/finalsize">{finalsize}</a> and upcoming <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epidemics">{epidemics}</a> packages.</p>

<section id="two-ways-to-share-c-code" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-ways-to-share-c-code">Two ways to share C++ code?</h2>
<p>Developers searching for a way to make the C++ code of their Rcpp-based packages shareable will likely find two seemingly distinct ways of doing so.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Developers reading the Rcpp Attributes documentation will find that package C++ code can be shared by generating a C++ interface for functions that also have an R interface, <a href="https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/Rcpp-attributes.pdf">using Rcpp attributes</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Developers instead scanning widely used Rcpp packages such as {RcppEigen} will notice that C++ code can also be shared by defining the majority of the C++ functions in a package header, to which other Rcpp packages can be linked.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are simply different pathways to the writing and export of an R(cpp) package header, which allows Rcpp to link the package’s C++ code to other packages.</p>
<p>This blog post explores different ways of doing this, and explains how the Rcpp packages from Epiverse-TRACE implement C++ code sharing.</p>

<section id="the-package-header" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-package-header">The package header</h2>
<p>The package header of the package <code>{mypackage}</code> is a file of the name <code>mypackage.h</code> under <code>inst/include</code>. Defining this header is the key step in making (R)C++ code shareable.</p>

<section id="manually-creating-the-package-header" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="manually-creating-the-package-header">Manually creating the package header</h3>
<p>The package header can also be created manually, as <code>mypackage.h</code> under <code>inst/include</code>. In this case, the helper file <code>mypackage_RcppExports.h</code> is not generated.</p>
<p>Examples of this are the widely used {RcppEigen} and {RcppArmadillo} packages, while <a href="https://github.com/coatless-r-n-d/rcpp-shared-cpp-functions">this demonstration package by James Balamuta</a> is a minimal example that is a good place to get started to understand how this approach works.</p>
<p>The manually defined package header can initially be empty, and is populated by the developer — more on header contents below.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>It is possible to edit an autogenerated package header to include manually created header files in addition to <code>mypackage_RcppExports.h</code>. To do this, remove the generator tag (see below) to prevent this file from being overwritten by <code>Rcpp::compileAttributes()</code>. Then include any extra header files as usual.</p>
<p>We would however recommend not autogenerating headers from Rcpp functions, but rather writing a header-heavy package — this is the approach used by {RcppEigen} etc. (see more below on how we organise our packages).</p>

</div>
</section>
<section id="contents-of-the-package-header" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contents-of-the-package-header">Contents of the package header</h3>
<p>We found it difficult to get information on the content of the package header.</p>
<p>Autogenerated package headers contain an autogeneration message and a generator token, similar to that present in <code>RcppExports</code> files. Package headers should contain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard">header include guard</a>.</p>

Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The style of the header name in the include guard for autogenerated headers is <code>RCPP_mypackage_H_GEN_</code>. Package headers from the Rcpp core team, such as {RcppEigen} and {RcppArmadillo}, are manually defined and follow the convention <code>mypackage__mypackage__h</code>. In examples, <a href="https://github.com/coatless-r-n-d/rcpp-shared-cpp-functions">such as this bare-bones demonstration package by James Balamuta</a>, you might also encounter a single underscore (<code>_</code>) and a capital <code>H</code> (<code>mypackage_mypackage_H</code>).</p>
<p>If you are <a href="../lint-rcpp/">linting your Rcpp package’s C++ code</a> with <a href="https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint">Cpplint</a>, all three are incompatible with Cpplint’s preference, which is <code>DIR_SUBDIR_FILE_H</code>. Exclude the package header from linting to avoid this warning if you wish to follow an Rcpp community style instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The package header must also link to the code you want to export, and there are at least three ways of doing this.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Include the autogenerated file <code>mypackage_RcppExports.h</code>; this is already done as part of the package header generation.</li>
<li>Directly write C++ code in the package header. This is technically possible, but unlikely to be a good option as your package’s C++ codebase grows.</li>
<li>Manually include any other C++ header files in the package header. This last option might lead to a package header such as that shown below.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-header-code-in-the-package">Using header code in the package</h2>
<p>There are some considerations when seeking to use header code from {mypackage} within {mypackage} itself.</p>
<p>Any functions defined in the package headers must be inline functions (see the example above). This prevents compilation errors related to multiple definitions.</p>
<p>C++ source files should include the package header, using <code>#include mypackage.h</code>. Functions, structs, or classes defined in header files will be available from the namespace <code>mypackage</code>, as shown in the example below.</p>

<p>In Epiverse-TRACE, we have structured the {finalsize} and {epidemics} packages to have manually created headers, following the principles laid out above. We follow some additional principles as well.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Header-heavy packages</dt>
<dd>
Our packages are header-heavy, so that most of the actual code is defined in the headers. The source files are primarily intended to contain wrappers that expose the header code to R (and our users).
</dd>
<dt>Namespaces to organise header code</dt>
<dd>
Our header code is organised into C++ namespaces, which makes it easier to understand where functions are likely to be defined, and what they might be related to. It also makes it possible to include the package headers (and namespaces) that are relevant to users, rather than including the entire codebase.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As an example, functions related to non-pharmaceutical interventions or vaccination regimes from the {epidemics} package can be used in other packages without also including the compartmental epidemic models contained therein.</p>

<section id="ensuring-the-quality-of-header-code" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ensuring-the-quality-of-header-code">Ensuring the quality of header code</h2>
<p>You can lint and statically check code in a package header using <a href="../lint-rcpp/">tools for linting C++ code such as Cpplint and Cppcheck</a>. When doing so, it may be important to specify minimum C++ standards, or even the language (C or C++) to avoid linter errors. This is because tools — such as Cppcheck — assume that headers with the extension <code>.h</code> are C headers, which throws errors when encountering C++ features such as the use of namespaces.</p>
<p>Cppcheck’s language and C++ standard can be set using:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode sh code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

font-style: inherit;">*</span>.h</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Furthermore, header code can also be tested independently of the R(cpp) code that eventually wraps it. This can be done using the <a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2">Catch2 testing framework</a>, which is <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/use_catch.html">conveniently available using {testthat}</a> — this is an extensive topic for another post.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Developing an Rcpp-based package with C++ code sharing in mind takes some organisation, or even reorganisation, of the C++ codebase. It is probably a good idea to consider whether your package will implement code that would be of interest to other developers, or to you in related projects. If either of these is true, it may help to structure your package with C++ code sharing in mind from the very beginning of development. This can substantially reduce development overheads and mistakes associated with maintaining multiple copies of the same or similar code in different projects. Fortunately, some great examples of how to do this are among the most-used Rcpp-based packages, providing both a conceptual template to consult for your work, as well as being a demonstration of how beneficial this practice can be in the long run. In Epiverse-TRACE, we intend to continue developing with C++ code sharing as a core principle so that we and other developers can build on our initial work.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extending-data-frames-in-r">Extending Data Frames in R</h2>
<p>R is a commonly used language for data science and statistical computing. Foundational to this is having data structures that allow manipulation of data with minimal effort and cognitive load. One of the most commonly required data structures is tabular data. This can be represented in R in a few ways, for example a matrix or a data frame. The data frame (class <code>data.frame</code>) is a flexible tabular data structure, as it can hold different data types (e.g.&nbsp;numbers, character strings, etc.) across different columns. This is in contrast to matrices – which are arrays with dimensions – and thus can only hold a single data type.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear why data frames are so prevalent. However, they are not without limitations. They have a relatively basic printing method which can fload the R console when the number of columns or rows is large. They have useful methods (e.g., <code>summary()</code> and <code>str()</code>), but these might not be appropriate for certain types of tabular data. In these cases it is useful to utilise R’s inheritance mechanisms (specifically S3 inheritance) to write extensions for R’s <code>data.frame</code> class. In this case the data frame is the superclass and the new subclass extends it and inherits its methods (see <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#s3-inheritance">the <em>Advanced R</em> book</a> for more details on S3 inheritance).</p>
<p>One of the most common extension of the data frame is the <code>tibble</code> from the {tibble} R package. Outlined in <a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org/articles/tibble.html">{tibble}’s vignette</a>, <code>tibble</code>s offer improvements in printing, subsetting and recycling rules. Another commonly used data frame extension is the <code>data.table</code> class from the <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table">{data.table} R package</a>. In addition to the improved printing, this class is designed to improve the performance (i.e.&nbsp;speed and efficiency of operations and storage) of working with tabular data in R and provide a terse syntax for manipulation.</p>
<p>In the process of developing R software (most likely an R package), a new tabular data class that builds atop data frames can become beneficial. This blog post has two main sections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a brief overview of the steps required to setup a class that extends data frames</li>
<li>guide to the technical aspects of class invariants (required data members of a class) and design and implementation decisions, and tidyverse compatibility</li>
</ol>
<section id="writing-a-custom-data-class" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="writing-a-custom-data-class">Writing a custom data class</h3>
<p>It is useful to write a class constructor function that can be called to create an object of your new class. The functions defined below are a redacted version (for readability) of functions available in the <a href="https://github.com/joshwlambert/ExtendDataFrames">{ExtendDataFrames} R package</a>, which contains example functions and files discussed in this post. When assigning the class name ensure that it is a vector containing <code>"data.frame"</code> as the last element to correctly inherit properties and methods from the <code>data.frame</code> class.</p>

<p>That’s all that’s needed to create a subclass of a data frame. However, although we’ve created the class we haven’t given it any functionality and thus it will be identical to a data frame due to inheritance.</p>
<p>We can now write as many methods as we want. Here we will show two methods, one of which does not require writing a generic (<code>print.birthdays</code>) and the second that does (<code>birthdays_per_month</code>). The <code>print()</code> generic function is provided by R, which is why we do not need to add one ourselves. See <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#s3-methods">Adv R</a> and this <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/s3-generic/">Epiverse blog post</a> to find out more about S3 generics.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design-decision-around-class-invariants">Design decision around class invariants</h3>
<p>We will now move on to the second section of the post, in which we discuss the design choices when creating and using S3 classes in R. <strong><em>Class invariants</em></strong> are members of your class that define it. In other words, without these elements your class does not fulfil its basic definition. It is therefore sensible to make sure that your class contains these elements at all times (or at least after operations have been applied to your class). In cases when the class object contains all the invariants normal service can be continued. However, in the case that an invariant is missing or modified to a non-conformist type (e.g.&nbsp;a date converted to a numeric) a decision has to be made. Either the code can error, hopefully giving the user an informative message as to why their modification broke the object; alternatively, the subclass can be revoked and the superclass can be returned. In almost all cases the superclass (i.e.&nbsp;the base class being inherited from) is more general and won’t have the same class invariant restrictions.</p>
<p>For our example class, <code>&lt;birthdays&gt;</code>, the invariants are a column called <code>name</code> which must contain characters, and a column called <code>birthday</code> which must contain dates. The order of the rows and columns is not considered an invariant property, and having extra columns with other names and data types is also allowed. The number of rows is also not an invariant as we can have as many birthdays as we like in the data object.</p>
<p>Here we present both cases as well as considerations and technical details of both options. We’ll demonstrate both of these cases with the subset function in R (subsetting uses a single square bracket for tabular data, <code>[</code>). First the fail-on-subsetting. Before we write the subsetting function it is useful to have a function that checks that an object of our class is valid, a so-called validator function.</p>

<p>This will return an error if the class is not valid (defined in terms of the class’ invariants).</p>
<p>Now we can show how to error if one of the invariants are removed during subsetting. See <code>?NextMethod()</code> for information on method dispatch.</p>

<p>The second design option is the reconstruct-on-subsetting. This checks whether the class is valid, and if not downgrade the class to the superclass, in our case a data frame. This is done by not only validating the object during subsetting but to check whether it is a valid class object, and then either ensuring all of the attributes of the subclass – in our case <code>&lt;birthdays&gt;</code> – are maintained, or attributes are stripped and only the attributes of the base superclass – in our case <code>data.frame</code> – are kept.</p>

<p>The four functions that are required to be added to ensure our class is correctly handled when invaliding it are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>birthdays_reconstruct()</code></li>
<li><code>birthdays_can_reconstruct()</code></li>
<li><code>df_reconstruct()</code></li>
<li><code>dplyr_reconstruct.birthdays()</code></li>

<p>We’ll tackle the first three first, and then move onto to the last one as this requires some extra steps.</p>
<p><code>birthdays_reconstruct()</code> is a function that contains an if-else statement to determine whether the returned object is a <code>&lt;birthdays&gt;</code> or <code>data.frame</code> object.</p>

<p>The three functions defined for reconstruction can be added to a package with the subsetting function in order to subset <code>&lt;birthdays&gt;</code> objects and returning either <code>&lt;birthdays&gt;</code> objects if still valid, or data frames when invalidated. This design has the benefit that when conducting data exploration a user is not faced with an error, but can continue with a data frame, while being informed by the message printed to console in <code>birthdays_reconstruct()</code>.</p>

<p>In order to be able to operate on our <code>&lt;birthdays&gt;</code> class using functions from the package {dplyr}, as would be common for data frames, we need to make our function compatible. This is where the function <code>dplyr_reconstruct.birthdays()</code> comes in. <code>dplyr_reconstruct()</code> is a generic function exported by {dplyr}. It is called in {dplyr} verbs to make sure that the objects are restored to the input class when not invalidated.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb24" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb24-1">dplyr_reconstruct.birthdays <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;

</div>
<p>As explained in the help documentation, {dplyr} also uses two base R functions to perform data manipulation. <code>names&lt;-</code> (i.e the names setter function) and <code>[</code> the one-dimensional subsetting function. We therefore define these methods for our custom class in order for <code>dplyr_reconstruct()</code> to work as intended.</p>

</div>
<p>This wraps up the need for adding function to perform data manipulation using the reconstruction design outlined above.</p>
<p>However, there is some final housekeeping to do. In cases when {dplyr} is not a package dependency (either imported or suggested), then the S3 generic <code>dplyr_reconstruct()</code> is required to be loaded. In R versions before 3.6.0 – this also works for R versions later than 3.6.0 – the generic function needs to be registered. This is done by writing an <code>.onLoad()</code> function, typically in a file called <code>zzz.R</code>. This is included in the {ExtendDataFrames} package for illustrative purposes.</p>
<!-- 
  This is not yet documented in quarto but it looks like code blocks with the
  'filename' instruction needs .r rather than r as language.

<span id="cb27-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code>s3_register()</code> function used in <code>.onLoad()</code> also needs to be added to the package and this function is kindly supplied by both {vctrs} and {rlang} unlicensed and thus can be copied into another package. See the <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-mindset-background.html#sec-dependencies-attach-vs-load">R packages book</a> for information about <code>.onLoad()</code> and attaching and loading in general.</p>
<p>Since R version 3.6.0 this <a href="https://blog.r-project.org/2019/08/19/s3-method-lookup/index.html">S3 generic registration</a> happens automatically with <code>S3Method()</code> in the package namespace using the {roxygen2} documentation <code>#' @exportS3Method dplyr::dplyr_reconstruct</code>.</p>
<p>There is one last option which prevents the hard dependency on a relatively recent R version. Since {roxygen2} version 6.1.0, there is the <code>@rawNamespace</code> tag which allows insertion of text into the NAMESPACE file. Using this tag the following code will check the local R version and register the S3 method if equal to or above 3.6.0.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb28" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb28-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">#' @rawNamespace if (getRversion() &gt;= "3.6.0") {</span></span>
<span id="cb28-2"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">#'   S3method(pkg::fun, class)</span></span>
<span id="cb28-3"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">#' }</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each of the three options for registering S3 methods has different benefits and downsides, so the choice depends on the specific use-case. Over time it may be best to use the most up-to-date methods as packages are usually only maintained for a handful of recent R releases<sup>1</sup>.</p>

  <title>Convert Your R Function to an S3 Generic: Benefits, Pitfalls &amp; Design Considerations</title>
  <dc:creator>Hugo Gruson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/s3-generic/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>To build a tight and well-integrated data pipeline, it may be desirable to rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object orientation (OO)</a> to automatically pass valuable information from one step to the other. OO and data classes can also act as a compatibility layer standardising outputs from various tools under a common structure.</p>
<p>But many packages and software start as standalone projects, and don’t always stem from a careful consideration of the larger ecosystem. In this situation, developers often see little benefit of using an OO system in their project initially.</p>
<p>But as the project matures, and as the position of the tool in the wider ecosystem becomes clearer, they may want to start using OO to benefit from the better integration it may provide with other tools upstream and downstream in the data pipeline. However, by then, their tool likely has an established community of users, and it is important to tread carefully with breaking changes.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we show that it’s possible to start using an S3 OO system almost invisibly in your R package, with minimal disruption to your users. We detail some minor changes that will nonetheless occur, and which pitfalls you should be looking out for. Finally, we take a step back and reflect how you should ensure you are a good open-source citizen in this endeavour.</p>
<section id="benefits" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>Let’s reuse the example function from <a href="../statistical-correctness/">one of our previous posts</a>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<span id="cb1-6">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Since we wrote and released this function, someone may have designed a clever data class to store coordinates of a set of points and their weights. Let’s imagine they use the following class that they call <code>pointset</code>:</p>

<p>They may also have developed nice utilities for this class so there is a clear motivation for you to integrate with their class since it’s less work you’ll have to do. Plus, you immediately become compatible with any package that uses the same class.</p>
<p>We will not spend too much time on the practical steps to operate this conversion since this is already covered in details in <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html">the dedicated chapter of Advanced R, by Hadley Wickham</a>, as well as <a href="https://njtierney.github.io/r/missing%20data/rbloggers/2016/11/06/simple-s3-methods/">this blog post from Nick Tierney</a> <sup>1</sup>.

<p>You can see that the method for <code>pointset</code> class, <code>centroid.pointset()</code> has a <code>weights</code> argument, even though it is not used because weights are already contained in the <code>coords</code> object. This seems clunky and potentially confusing for users. But this is mandatory because all methods must have the same arguments as the generic.</p>
<p>Another option here could have been to remove <code>weights</code> from the generic, and add <code>...</code> instead, thus allowing to pass <code>weights</code> as an extra argument only in selected methods. This is more idiomatic in R, and in line with the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Generic-functions-and-methods">recommendation from the official ‘Writing R Extensions’ document (“always keep generics simple”)</a>:</p>

<p>On the topic of arguments, another pitfall related to the conversion to an S3 generic is the change in the documentation. Below is a collage of before / after the change. This is quite minor and some users may not even notice it but I remember it was very confusing to me when I started using R and I didn’t really know what S3 or OO was: “what do you mean, ‘Default S3 method’, which case applies to me?”</p>

<p>The answer is that “Default S3 method” lists the arguments for <code>centroid.default()</code>, i.e., the method which is used if no other method is defined for your class. Arguments for all methods are usually documented together but you should only focus on those present in the call after the comment stating “S3 method for class ‘XXX’” for the class you’re working with.</p>
</section>
<section id="more-complicated-error-traceback" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-complicated-error-traceback">More complicated error traceback</h3>
<p>Another situation where converting to an S3 adds an extra layer of complexity is where you are trying to follow the error <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace">traceback</a>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

font-style: inherit;">centroid</span>(<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;

font-style: inherit;">3</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><img src="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/s3-generic/error_trace.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In this example, we see one extra line that did not exist when <code>centroid()</code> was a regular function, rather than a generic:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>centroid.default(3) at centroid.R#19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This line corresponds to the dispatch operation.</p>
<p>However, this slight difference in behaviour is likely not a big issue as we mostly expect experienced users to interact with the traceback. These users are likely to be familiar with S3 dispatch and understand the traceback in any case.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extra-source-of-bugs-during-dispatch">Extra source of bugs during dispatch</h3>
<p>On a related note, the extra step introduced by this conversion to generic is another potential source of bugs. This doesn’t really impact your users directly but it does mean that as a developer, you will maintaining slightly more complex code and you will need to be more careful when making any changes. However, as always, a robust testing suite should help you catch any error before it makes it to production.</p>

<section id="where-should-the-generic-methods-live" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-should-the-generic-methods-live">Where should the generic &amp; methods live?</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we mentioned that you may want to rely on existing, established S3 classes. How does it work in practice when you want to add a method for a class outside of your package? Do you need to import the package where the class is defined? On the other side of the fence, as a class developer, is it okay to provide methods for generics provided in other packages? If you have the choice, should the method live in the package defining the generic or the class?</p>
<section id="where-should-the-generic-live" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-should-the-generic-live">Where should the generic live?</h3>
<p>The generic should always live in the package implementing the actual computation in the function in the first place. For example, if you defined the original <code>centroid()</code> function in a package called geometryops, the S3 generic should also be defined in that package, not in the package defining the <code>pointset</code> class.</p>
<p>It is possible in theory to overwrite a function defined by another package with a generic (“overloading”). For example, we could overload base R <code>table()</code> function with:</p>

<p>But this is generally considered bad practice, and possibly rude <sup>2</sup>. As a rule of thumb, you should usually avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>name collisions with functions from other packages (especially base or recommended package);</li>
<li>light wrappers around a function from another package as this may be seen as an attempt to steal citations and credit.</li>

This is the approach taken in the <a href="https://easystats.github.io/report/">report package</a> from example, which defines the <code>report()</code> generic and methods for various model outputs produced by different package.</p>
<p>In theory, no <code>Imports</code> or <code>Suggests</code> is required here:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb14" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">function</span>(x, ...) { </span>
<span id="cb14-3">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">UseMethod</span>(x)</span>
<span id="cb14-4">}</span>
<span id="cb14-5"></span>
<span id="cb14-6"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">#' @export</span></span>
<span id="cb14-7">mygeneric.externalclass <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;

font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;

<span id="cb14-8">  <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"># your code here</span></span>
<span id="cb14-9">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>However, if you end up providing many methods for a specific class, you could put the package defining it in the uncommon <code>Enhances</code> field. <code>Enhances</code> is defined in ‘<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">Writing R Extensions</a>’ as:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The ‘Enhances’ field lists packages “enhanced” by the package at hand, e.g., by providing methods for classes from these packages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be a good idea to explicitly signal the strong relationship between both packages so that the package defining the method is checked as a reverse dependency, and informed of potential breaking changes as discussed below. You may see an example of this in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=slam">slam package</a>, which provides his methods for both base matrices and sparse matrices, as defined in the Matrix and the spam packages.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coordination-between-maintainers">Coordination between maintainers</h4>
<p>No matter the strategy you end up choosing, we strongly recommend you keep an open communication channel between the class package and the generic package developer (provided they are not the same person) as breaking changes will impact both parties.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As we’ve seen here, there are clear benefits to converting your standard function to an S3 generic. This can be done <strong>almost</strong> transparently but we’ve highlighting some subtle changes you may want to consider before pulling the switch.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>If you like S3 and find it helpful to convert your function to an S3 class, you should keep propagating the S3 love by also adding an S3 class to your function output.</p>
<p>With this in mind, in the very first example where we converted our <code>centroid()</code> function to an S3 generic to handle <code>pointset</code> objects, we could also make our output a <code>pointset</code> object.</p>

  <title>Improving the C++ Code Quality of an Rcpp Package</title>
  <dc:creator>Pratik Gupte</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="use-case" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case">Use case</h2>
<p>The R package development ecosystem includes packages such as <a href="https://lintr.r-lib.org/">{lintr}</a> and <a href="https://styler.r-lib.org">{styler}</a> that can help to check code style, and to format R code.</p>
<p>However, these packages cannot lint or style the C++ code of <a href="https://www.rcpp.org/">{Rcpp}</a> packages. This could leave the C++ code of an Rcpp package less clean than the R code, increasing the technical debt already associated with using two languages.</p>
<p>In Epiverse-TRACE, we encounter this issue with <a href="https://epiverse-trace.github.io/finalsize/">{finalsize}</a>, and we anticipate the same issue with further epidemic modelling packages that we seek to develop or adapt, such as <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005838">{fluEvidenceSynthesis}</a>.</p>
<p>Our use-case is not unique, of course, and other projects could have their own solutions. One such, from which we have borrowed some ideas, is the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow project</a>, whose R package also uses a C++ backend (via <a href="https://cpp11.r-lib.org/">{cpp11}</a> rather than {Rcpp}).</p>
</section>
<section id="choice-of-c-linters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choice-of-c-linters">Choice of C++ linters</h2>
<p>C++ linters such as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/"><em>clang-tidy</em></a> stumble when dealing with C++ code in <code>src/</code>, as the <em>clang</em> toolchain attempts to compile it. This does not work for Rcpp packages, as the <code>Rcpp.h</code> header cannot be found — this linking is handled by {Rcpp}.</p>
<p>Fortunately, other C++ linters and code checking tools are available and can be used safely with Rcpp packages.</p>
<p>We have chosen to use <em>cpplint</em> and <em>cppcheck</em> for {finalsize}.</p>
<section id="cpplint" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cpplint">Cpplint</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint"><em>cpplint</em></a> is a tool that checks whether C/C++ files follow <a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">Google’s C++ style guide</a>. <em>cpplint</em> is easy to install across platforms, and does not error when it cannot find <code>Rcpp.h</code>.</p>
<p>Importantly, <em>cpplint</em> can be instructed to not lint the autogenerated <code>RcppExports.cpp</code> file, which follows a different style.</p>
<p>To lint all other <code>.cpp</code> files, we simply run <code>cpplint</code> from the terminal.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode sh code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">cpplint</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--exclude</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"src/RcppExports.cpp"</span> src/<span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">*</span>.cpp</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="cppcheck" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cppcheck">Cppcheck</h3>
<p><a href="https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/"><em>cppcheck</em></a> is a static code analysis tool, that aims to “have very few false positives”. This is especially useful for the non-standard organisation of Rcpp projects compared to C++ projects.</p>
<p><em>cppcheck</em> can also be run locally and instructed to ignore the autogenerated <code>RcppExports.cpp</code> file, while throwing up issues with style.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode sh code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">cppcheck</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">-i</span> src/RcppExports.cpp <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--enable</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span>style <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--error-exitcode</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span>1 src</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the <code>--enable=style</code> option lets <em>cppcheck</em> flag issues with style, acting as a second linter. This enables the <code>performance</code> and <code>portability</code> flags as well. (We have not found any difference when using <code>--enable=warning</code> instead.)</p>
<p>Enabling all checks (<code>--enable=all</code>) would flag two specific issues for {Rcpp} packages: (1) the <code>Rcpp*.h</code> headers not being found (of the class <code>missingIncludeSystem</code>), and (2) the solver functions not being used by any other C++ function (<code>unusedFunction</code>).</p>
<p>These extra options should be avoided in {Rcpp} packages, as the linking is handled for us, and the functions are indeed used later — just not by other C++ functions.</p>
<p>The <code>--error-exitcode=1</code> argument returns the integer <code>1</code> when an error is found, which is by convention the output for an error.</p>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode sh code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<p>However, this also formats the autogenerated <code>RcppExports.cpp</code> file. It can be extra work to repeatedly undo this change and keep the original formatting, but <em>clang-format</em> does not provide an easy inline way to ignore this file.</p>
<p>Instead, <em>clang-format</em> can be passed all files except <code>RcppExports.cpp</code> to style using some simple shell commands. In smaller projects, it might be worth</p>

<section id="turning-off-linting-and-formatting" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="turning-off-linting-and-formatting">Turning off linting and formatting</h2>
<p>There are cases in which we might want to turn linting and formatting off. This might be when the linter does not agree with valid C++ code required in the project, or when the linters and stylers do not agree with each other. These tools are developed separately by large software projects with their own internal requirements, and solutions to issues encountered in their work: <em>clang-format</em> by LLVM (although specifying <code>-style=google</code>), and <em>cpplint</em> from Google’s work.</p>
<section id="linter-enforced-paradigms" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linter-enforced-paradigms">Linter-enforced paradigms</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the linter or styler developer enforces both a style <em>and</em> the use of certain programming paradigms. An example from <em>cpplint</em> is when it warns against passing function arguments by reference, and prefers for these to be passed as pointers, or as constant references (<code>const int &amp;value</code>).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode cpp code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">int</span> some_function<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">(</span><span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">int</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&amp;</span>value<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">)</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">{</span> </span>
<span id="cb6-2">  <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">/* operations modifying value */</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3">  <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">return</span> value<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Passing the argument as a <code>const</code> reference would not serve the needs of this function, and passing by value is a valid strategy when we don’t want to get into the details of using pointers. (Note that this is typically an issue when large objects such as custom classes or structs are passed to a function multiple times.)</p>
<p>Similarly, <em>cpplint</em> will throw a warning about accessing variables using <code>std::move</code>, which is something we encounter in the Newton solver in {finalsize}. While not technically wrong for such a simple use case, the linter is correct to cautiously throw a warning nonetheless.</p>
</section>
<section id="linter-styler-disagreement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linter-styler-disagreement">Linter-styler disagreement</h3>
<p>One example of linter-styler disagreement is the use of <code>BOOST_FOREACH</code> from the <a href="https://www.boost.org/">Boost libraries</a> as an alternative to <code>for</code> loops. <em>clang-format</em> will insist on adding two spaces before the opening bracket: <code>BOOST_FOREACH  ()</code>. <em>cpplint</em> will insist on removing one space.</p>
<p><em>cpplint</em> and <em>clang-format</em> also disagree on the order of header inclusions, especially when both local and system headers are included.</p>
</section>
<section id="disabling-checks-on-code-chunks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disabling-checks-on-code-chunks">Disabling checks on code chunks</h3>
<p>Either of these cases could require disabling linting or formatting on some part of the code. It is possible to turn off linting using <em>cpplint</em> at particular lines using the comment <code>// NOLINT</code>. Multiple lines can be protected from linting as well.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode cpp code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<span id="cb7-3"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">// NOLINTEND</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, <em>clang-format</em> can be instructed to ignore chunks of code using comment messages too.</p>

<p>{finalsize} is a relatively simple {Rcpp} package, with no C/C++ headers, and no C++ tests. However, future Epiverse-TRACE packages could be more similar to {fluEvidenceSynthesis}, and will have header files, and could also have <a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2">C++ unit tests via the <em>catch</em> framework</a>.</p>
<p><em>cpplint</em> will demand that all local headers be prefixed with their directory (<code>src/</code>), but this would cause the code to break as {Rcpp} looks for a subdirectory called <code>src/src/</code>. This can be turned off by passing the filter option <code>--filter="-build/include_subdir"</code> to <em>cpplint</em>. Alternatively, we could place headers in a subdirectory such as <code>inst/include</code>.</p>
<p>Both <em>cpplint</em> and <em>cppcheck</em> can be instructed to ignore C++ test files using the <em>catch</em> testing framework provided by {testthat}. This prevents errors due to the specialised syntax provided by {testthat} in <code>testthat.h</code>, such as <code>context</code>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is actually somewhat surprising that there does not seem to be a canonical linter for C++ code in {Rcpp} packages. The methods laid out here are an initial implementation developed for use with the {finalsize} package, and the considerations here are a starting point. We shall be continuously evaluating how we ensure the quality of our C++ code as we encounter more use cases while developing future Epiverse-TRACE packages.</p>

  <title>Ensuring &amp; Showcasing the Statistical Correctness of your R Package</title>
  <dc:creator>Hugo Gruson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/statistical-correctness/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We’re evolving in an increasingly data-driven world. And since critical decisions are taken based on results produced by data scientists and data analysts, they need to be be able to trust the tools they use. It is now increasingly common to add continuous integration to software packages and libraries, to ensure the code is not crashing, and that future updates don’t change your code output (snapshot tests). But one type of test still remains uncommon: tests for statistical correctness. That is, tests that ensure the algorithm implemented in your package actually produce the correct results.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Does <a href="https://twitter.com/rstudio"><span class="citation" data-cites="rstudio">@rstudio</span></a> have a position in the trustworthiness / validity of any ~statistical methods~ packages in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rstats">#Rstats</a>?</p>
<p>Or, is there a list of packages that <a href="https://twitter.com/rstudio"><span class="citation" data-cites="rstudio">@rstudio</span></a> considers ‘approved’ and thus will recommend to clients?</p>
<p>— <em>(deleted tweet)</em> February 3, 2019</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is likely that most statistical package authors run some tests on their own during development but there doesn’t seem to be guidelines on how to test statistical correctness in a solid and standard way <sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we explore various methods to ensure the statistical correctness of your software. We argue that these tests should be part of your continuous integration system, to ensure your tools remains valid throughout its life, and to let users verify how you validate your package. Finally, we show how these principles are implemented in the Epiverse TRACE tools.</p>
<p>The approaches presented here are non-exclusive and should ideally all be added to your tests. However, they are presented in order of stringency and priority to implement. We also take a example of a function computing the centroid of a list of points to demonstrate how you would integrate the recommendations from this post with the <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/"><code>{testthat}</code> R package</a>, often used from unit testing:</p>

<p>Note that even if a <strong>reference</strong> implementation doesn’t exist, it is still good practice to compare your implementation to competing ones. Discrepancies might reveal a bug in your implementation or theirs but in any case, finding it out is beneficial to the community.</p>
<p>However, this approach cannot be used in all cases. Indeed, there may not be a reference implementation in your case. Or it might be difficult to replicate identical computations in the case of algorithm with stochasticity <sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>An alternative strategy is to compare your result to theoretical upper or lower bound. This offers a weaker guarantee that your implementation and your results are correct but it can still allow you to detect important mistakes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-automated-validation-vs-peer-review">Conclusion: automated validation vs peer-review</h2>
<p>In this post, we’ve presented different methods to automatically verify the statistical correctness of your statistical software. We would like to highlight one more time that it’s important to run these tests are part of your regular integration system, instead of running them just once at the start of the development. This will prevent the addition of possible errors in the code and show users what specific checks you are doing. By doing so, you are transparently committing to the highest quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2019/02/04/how-do-you-tell-what-packages-to-trust/">Multiple voices</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1092129977540231168">in the community</a> are pushing more towards peer-review as a proxy for quality and validity:</p>
<p></p><div id="tweet-81475"></div><script>tweet={"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hadleywickham\/status\/1092129977540231168","author_name":"Hadley Wickham","author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hadleywickham","html":"\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\"\u003E\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003EI don’t think we’d ever validate statistical methods. I’d look for other proxies like peer reviewed publications about the package. I generally prefer to trust _people_ rather than packages.\u003C\/p\u003E&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hadleywickham\/status\/1092129977540231168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003EFebruary 3, 2019\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cscript async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\n\n","width":550,"height":null,"type":"rich","cache_age":"3153600000","provider_name":"Twitter","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","version":"1.0"};document.getElementById("tweet-81475").innerHTML = tweet["html"];</script><p></p>
<p>We would like to highlight that automated validation and peer review are not mutually exclusive and answer slightly different purposes.</p>
<p>On the one hand, automated validation fails to catch more obscure bugs and edge cases. For example, a bug that would be difficult to detect via automated approach is the use of <a href="https://www.jottr.org/2020/09/22/push-for-statistical-sound-rng/">bad Random Number Generators when running in parallel</a>.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, peer-review is less scalable, and journals usually have some editorial policy that might not make your package a good fit. Additionally, peer-review usually happens at one point in time while automated validation can, and should, be part of the continuous integration system.</p>
<p>Ideally, peer-review and automated validation should work hand-in-hand, with review informing the addition of new automated validation tests.</p>
